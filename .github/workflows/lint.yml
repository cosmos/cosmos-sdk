      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources

      # And the GC guide suggests setting GOMEMLIMIT slightly under the available memory
      # when running on a dedicated system, which is a safe assumption in the CI job case.
