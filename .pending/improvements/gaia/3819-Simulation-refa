\#3819 Simulation refactor, log output now stored in ~/.gaiad/simulation/ 
 * Simulation moved to its own module (not a part of mock)
 * Logger type instead of passing function variables everywhere
 * Logger json output (for reloadable simulation running)
 * Cleanup bank simulation messages / remove dup code in bank simulation
 * Simulations saved in `~/.gaiad/simulations/` 
 * "Lean" simulation output option to exclude No-ops and !ok functions (`--SimulationLean` flag)
