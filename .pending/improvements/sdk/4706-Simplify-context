4706 - Simplify context

Replace complex Context construct with a simpler immutible struct.
Only breaking change is not to support `Value` and `GetValue` as first class calls.
We do embed ctx.Context() as a raw context.Context instead to be used as you see fit.

Migration guide:
`ctx = ctx.WithValue(contextKeyBadProposal, false)` ->
`ctx = ctx.WithContext(context.WithValue(ctx.Context(), contextKeyBadProposal, false))`
A bit more verbose, but also allows `context.WithTimeout()`, etc and only used
in one function in this repo, in test code.
