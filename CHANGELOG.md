<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking Protobuf, gRPC and REST routes used by end-users.
"CLI Breaking" for breaking CLI commands.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

### Bug Fixes

* (server) [#16827](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16827) Properly use `--trace` flag (before it was setting the trace level instead of displaying the stacktraces).
* (x/auth) [#16554](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16554) `ModuleAccount.Validate` now reports a nil `.BaseAccount` instead of panicking.
* [#16588](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16588) Propogate the Snapshotter's failure to the caller, (it will create a empty snapshot silently before).

NOTE: v0.45 and v0.46 were not using CometBFT logger either. This keeps the same underlying logger (zerolog) as in v0.45.x+ and v0.46.x+ but now properly supporting filtered logging.
* (gov) [#15979](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15979) Improve gov error message when failing to convert v1 proposal to v1beta1.

### API Breaking Changes

* (testutil) [#14991](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14991) The `testutil/testdata_pulsar` package has moved to `testutil/testdata/testpb`.  Chains will not notice this breaking change as this package contains testing utilities only used by the SDK internally.

In contexts where the block timestamp is needed for previous states, the timestamp will now be set. Note, when querying against a node it must be re-synced in order to be able to automatically populate the block timestamp. Otherwise, the block timestamp will be populated for heights going forward once upgraded.
