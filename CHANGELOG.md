<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Client Breaking

* (api) [\#6426](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6426) The ability to start an out-of-process API REST server has now been removed. Instead, the API server is now started in-process along with the application and Tendermint. Configuration options have been added to `app.toml` to enable/disable the API server along with additional HTTP server options.
* (baseapp) [\#6384](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6384) The `Result.Data` is now a Protocol Buffer encoded binary blob of type `TxData`. The `TxData` contains `Data` which contains a list of Protocol Buffer encoded message data and the corresponding message type.
* (x/gov) [#6295](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6295) Fix typo in querying governance params.
* (x/auth) [\#6054](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6054) Remove custom JSON marshaling for base accounts as multsigs cannot be bech32 decoded.
* (modules) [\#5572](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5572) The `/bank/balances/{address}` endpoint now returns all account
balances or a single balance by denom when the `denom` query parameter is present.
* (client) [\#5640](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5640) The rest server endpoint `/swagger-ui/` is replaced by ´/´.
* (x/auth) [\#5702](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5702) The `x/auth` querier route has changed from `"acc"` to `"auth"`.
* (store/rootmulti) [\#6390](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6390) Proofs of empty stores are no longer supported.
* (store/types) [\#5730](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5730) store.types.Cp() is removed in favour of types.CopyBytes().
* (client) [\#5640](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5783) Unify all coins representations on JSON client requests for governance proposals.
* [\#5785](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5785) JSON strings coerced to valid UTF-8 bytes at JSON marshalling time
are now replaced by human-readable expressions. This change can potentially break compatibility with all those client side tools
that parse log messages.
* (client) [\#5799](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5799) The `tx encode/decode` commands, due to change on encoding break compatibility with
older clients.
* (x/auth) [\#5844](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5844) `tx sign` command now returns an error when signing is attempted with offline/multisig keys.
* (x/auth) [\#6108](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6108) `tx sign` command's `--validate-signatures` flag is migrated into a `tx validate-signatures` standalone command.
* (client/keys) [\#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) Remove `keys update` command.
* (x/evidence) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Remove CLI and REST handlers for querying `x/evidence` parameters.
* (server) [\#5982](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5982) `--pruning` now must be set to `custom` if you want to customise the granular options.

### API Breaking Changes

* (client) [\#6525](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6525) Removed support for `indent` in JSON responses. Clients should consider piping to an external tool such as `jq`.
* (x/staking) [\#6451](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6451) `DefaultParamspace` and `ParamKeyTable` in staking module are moved from keeper to types to enforce consistency.
* [\#6409](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6409) Rename all IsEmpty methods to Empty across the codebase and enforce consistency.
* [\#6231](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6231) Simplify `AppModule` interface, `Route` and `NewHandler` methods become only `Route`
and returns a new `Route` type.

* (x/auth) [\#6029](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6029) Module accounts have been moved from `x/supply` to `x/auth`.
* (x/supply) [\#6010](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6010) All `x/supply` types and APIs have been moved to `x/bank`.
* (baseapp) [\#5865](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5865) The `SimulationResponse` returned from tx simulation is now JSON encoded instead of Amino binary.
* [\#5719](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5719) Bump Go requirement to 1.14+
* (x/params) [\#5619](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5619) The `x/params` keeper now accepts a `codec.Marshaller` instead of
a reference to an amino codec. Amino is still used for JSON serialization.
* (types) [\#5579](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5579) The `keepRecent` field has been removed from the `PruningOptions` type.
The `PruningOptions` type now only includes fields `KeepEvery` and `SnapshotEvery`, where `KeepEvery`
determines which committed heights are flushed to disk and `SnapshotEvery` determines which of these
heights are kept after pruning. The `IsValid` method should be called whenever using these options. Methods
`SnapshotVersion` and `FlushVersion` accept a version arugment and determine if the version should be
flushed to disk or kept as a snapshot. Note, `KeepRecent` is automatically inferred from the options
and provided directly the IAVL store.
* (modules) [\#5555](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5555) Move `x/auth/client/utils/` types and functions to `x/auth/client/`.

* (baseapp) [\#5837](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5837) Transaction simulation now returns a `SimulationResponse` which contains the `GasInfo` and
`Result` from the execution.
* (client/input) [\#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) Removal of unnecessary `GetCheckPassword`, `PrintPrefixed` functions.
* (client/keys) [\#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) Rename `NewKeyBaseFromDir()` -> `NewLegacyKeyBaseFromDir()`.

  * [\#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) `Keybase` -> `Keyring` interfaces migration. `LegacyKeybase` interface is added in order
to guarantee limited backward compatibility with the old Keybase interface for the sole purpose of migrating keys across the new keyring backends. `NewLegacy`
constructor is provided [\#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) to allow for smooth migration of keys from the legacy LevelDB based implementation
to new keyring backends. Plus, the package and the new keyring no longer depends on the sdk.Config singleton. Please consult the package documentation for more
information on how to implement the new `Keyring` interface.
  * [\#5858](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5858) Make Keyring store keys by name and address's hexbytes representation.
* (x/evidence) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Remove APIs for getting and setting `x/evidence` parameters. `BaseApp` now uses a `ParamStore` to manage Tendermint consensus parameters which is managed via the `x/params` `Substore` type.
* (export) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) `AppExporter` now returns ABCI consensus parameters to be included in marshaled exported state. These parameters must be returned from the application via the `BaseApp`.
* (codec) `*codec.Codec` is now a wrapper around Amino which provides backwards compatibility with protobuf `Any`.
ALL legacy code should use `*codec.Codec` instead of `*amino.Codec` directly
* (x/gov) [\#6147](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6147) The `Content` field on `Proposal` and `MsgSubmitProposal`
is now `Any` in concordance with [ADR 019](docs/architecture/adr-019-protobuf-state-encoding.md) and `GetContent` should now
be used to retrieve the actual proposal `Content`. Also the `NewMsgSubmitProposal` constructor now may return an `error`
* (modules) [\#5989](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5989) `AppModuleBasic.GetTxCmd` now takes a single `CLIContext` parameter.
* (x/auth) [\#5989](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5989) All `AccountRetriever` methods now take `NodeQuerier` as a parameter instead of as a struct member.
* (x/auth) [\#6270](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6270) The passphrase argument has been removed from the signature of the following functions and methods:
  - BuildAndSign
  - MakeSignature
  - SignStdTx
  - TxBuilder.BuildAndSign
  - TxBuilder.Sign
  - TxBuilder.SignStdTx
* (client) [\#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `CLIContext` is renamed to `Context`. `Context` and all related methods have been moved from package context to client.
* (modules) [\#6326](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6326) `AppModuleBasic.GetQueryCmd` now takes a single `CLIContext` parameter.
* (modules) [\#6336](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6336) `AppModuleBasic.RegisterQueryService` method was added to support gRPC queries, and `QuerierRoute` and `NewQuerierHandler` were deprecated.

* (modules) [\#6447](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6447) Rename `blacklistedAddrs` to `blockedAddrs`.
  
  Migration guide:

  ```go
  cliCtx := context.CLIContext{} 
  ```

  Now becomes:

  ```go
  clientCtx = client.Context{}
  ```

* (codec) [\#6330](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6330) `codec.RegisterCrypto` has been moved to the `crypto/codec` package and the global `codec.Cdc` Amino instance has been deprecated and moved to the `codec/legacy_global` package. 
* (x/ibc) [\#6374](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6374) `VerifyMembership` and `VerifyNonMembership` now take a `specs []string` argument to specify the proof format used for verification. Most SDK chains can simply use `commitmenttypes.GetSDKSpecs()` for this argument.
* (crypto/types/multisig) [\#6373](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6373) `multisig.Multisignature` has been renamed  to `AminoMultisignature`

  to define their own concrete `MsgSubmitProposal` types.
  * The module now accepts a `Codec` interface which extends the `codec.Marshaler` interface by
  requiring a concrete codec to know how to serialize `Proposal` types.
* (codec) [\#5799](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5799) Now we favor the use of `(Un)MarshalBinaryBare` instead of `(Un)MarshalBinaryLengthPrefixed` in all cases that are not needed.
* (x/evidence) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Remove parameters from `x/evidence` genesis and module state. The `x/evidence` module now solely uses Tendermint consensus parameters to determine of evidence is valid or not.

### Improvements

* (baseapp) [\#6186](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6186) Support emitting events during `AnteHandler` execution.
* (x/auth) [\#5702](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5702) Add parameter querying support for `x/auth`.

* (staking) [\#5584](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5584) Add util function `ToTmValidator` that converts a `staking.Validator` type to `*tmtypes.Validator`.
* (client) [\#5585](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5585) IBC additions:
  * Added `prove` flag for commitment proof verification.
  * Added `queryABCI` function that returns the full `abci.ResponseQuery` with inclusion merkle proofs.
* (types) [\#5585](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5585) IBC additions:
  * `Coin` denomination max lenght has been increased to 32.
  * Added `CapabilityKey` alias for `StoreKey` to match IBC spec.
* (server) [\#5709](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5709) There are two new flags for pruning, `--pruning-keep-every`
and `--pruning-snapshot-every` as an alternative to `--pruning`. They allow to fine tune the strategy for pruning the state.
* (client) [\#5810](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5810) Added a new `--offline` flag that allows commands to be executed without an
internet connection. Previously, `--generate-only` served this purpose in addition to only allowing txs to be generated. Now, `--generate-only` solely
allows txs to be generated without being broadcasted and disallows Keybase use and `--offline` allows the use of Keybase but does not allow any
functionality that requires an online connection.
* (types/module) [\#5724](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5724) The `types/module` package does no longer depend on `x/simulation`.
* (client) [\#5856](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5856) Added the possibility to set `--offline` flag with config command.
* (client) [\#5895](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5895) show config options in the config command's help screen.
* (types/rest) [\#5900](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5900) Add Check*Error function family to spare developers from replicating tons of boilerplate code.
* (x/evidence) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Tendermint Consensus parameters can now be changed via parameter change proposals through `x/gov`.
* (x/evidence) [\#5961](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5961) Add `StoreDecoder` simulation for evidence module.
* (x/auth/ante) [\#6040](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6040) `AccountKeeper` interface used for `NewAnteHandler` and handler's decorators to add support of using custom `AccountKeeper` implementations.
* (simulation) [\#6002](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6002) Add randomized consensus params into simulation.
* (x/staking) [\#6059](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6059) Updated `HistoricalEntries` parameter default to 100.

* (x/staking) [\#6163](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6163) CLI and REST call to unbonding delegations and delegations now accept
pagination.
* (types) [\#6128](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6137) Add `String()` method to `GasMeter`.
* (types) [\#6195](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6195) Add codespace to broadcast(sync/async) response.
* (baseapp) [\#6053](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6053) Customizable panic recovery handling added for `app.runTx()` method (as proposed in the [ADR 22](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-022-custom-panic-handling.md)). Adds ability for developers to register custom panic handlers extending standard ones.
* (store) [\#6481](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6481) Move `SimpleProofsFromMap` from Tendermint into the SDK.

## [v0.38.4] - 2020-05-21

### Bug Fixes

* (x/auth) [\#5950](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5950) Fix `IncrementSequenceDecorator` to use is `IsReCheckTx` instead of `IsCheckTx` to allow account sequence incrementing.

## [v0.38.3] - 2020-04-09

### Improvements

* (tendermint) Bump Tendermint version to [v0.33.3](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.33.3).

## [v0.38.2] - 2020-03-25

### Bug Fixes

* (baseapp) [\#5718](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5718) Remove call to `ctx.BlockGasMeter` during failed message validation which resulted in a panic when the tx execution mode was `CheckTx`.
* (x/genutil) [\#5775](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5775) Fix `ExportGenesis` in `x/genutil` to export default genesis state (`[]`) instead of `null`.
* (client) [\#5618](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5618) Fix crash on the client when the verifier is not set.
* (crypto/keys/mintkey) [\#5823](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5823) fix errors handling in `UnarmorPubKeyBytes` (underlying armoring function's return error was not being checked).
* (x/distribution) [\#5620](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5620) Fix nil pointer deref in distribution tax/reward validation helpers.

### Improvements

* (rest) [\#5648](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5648) Enhance /txs usability:
  * Add `tx.minheight` key to filter transaction with an inclusive minimum block height
  * Add `tx.maxheight` key to filter transaction with an inclusive maximum block height
* (crypto/keys) [\#5739](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5739) Print an error message if the password input failed.

## [v0.38.1] - 2020-02-11

### Improvements

* (modules) [\#5597](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5597) Add `amount` event attribute to the `complete_unbonding`
and `complete_redelegation` events that reflect the total balances of the completed unbondings and redelegations
respectively.

### Bug Fixes

* (types) [\#5579](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5579) The IAVL `Store#Commit` method has been refactored to
delete a flushed version if it is not a snapshot version. The root multi-store now keeps track of `commitInfo` instead
of `types.CommitID`. During `Commit` of the root multi-store, `lastCommitInfo` is updated from the saved state
and is only flushed to disk if it is a snapshot version. During `Query` of the root multi-store, if the request height
is the latest height, we'll use the store's `lastCommitInfo`. Otherwise, we fetch `commitInfo` from disk.
* (x/bank) [\#5531](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5531) Added missing amount event to MsgMultiSend, emitted for each output.
* (x/gov) [\#5622](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5622) Track any events emitted from a proposal's handler upon successful execution.

## [v0.38.0] - 2020-01-23

### State Machine Breaking

* (genesis) [\#5506](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5506) The `x/distribution` genesis state
  now includes `params` instead of individual parameters.
* (genesis) [\#5017](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5017) The `x/genaccounts` module has been
deprecated and all components removed except the `legacy/` package. This requires changes to the
genesis state. Namely, `accounts` now exist under `app_state.auth.accounts`. The corresponding migration
logic has been implemented for v0.38 target version. Applications can migrate via:
`$ {appd} migrate v0.38 genesis.json`.
* (modules) [\#5299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5299) Handling of `ABCIEvidenceTypeDuplicateVote`
  during `BeginBlock` along with the corresponding parameters (`MaxEvidenceAge`) have moved from the
  `x/slashing` module to the `x/evidence` module.

### API Breaking Changes

* (modules) [\#5506](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5506) Remove individual setters of `x/distribution` parameters. Instead, follow the module spec in getting parameters, setting new value(s) and finally calling `SetParams`.
* (types) [\#5495](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5495) Remove redundant `(Must)Bech32ify*` and `(Must)Get*KeyBech32` functions in favor of `(Must)Bech32ifyPubKey` and `(Must)GetPubKeyFromBech32` respectively, both of which take a `Bech32PubKeyType` (string).
* (types) [\#5430](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5430) `DecCoins#Add` parameter changed from `DecCoins`
to `...DecCoin`, `Coins#Add` parameter changed from `Coins` to `...Coin`.
* (baseapp/types) [\#5421](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5421) The `Error` interface (`types/errors.go`)
has been removed in favor of the concrete type defined in `types/errors/` which implements the standard `error` interface.
  * As a result, the `Handler` and `Querier` implementations now return a standard `error`.
  Within `BaseApp`, `runTx` now returns a `(GasInfo, *Result, error)` tuple and `runMsgs` returns a
  `(*Result, error)` tuple. A reference to a `Result` is now used to indicate success whereas an error
  signals an invalid message or failed message execution. As a result, the fields `Code`, `Codespace`,
  `GasWanted`, and `GasUsed` have been removed the `Result` type. The latter two fields are now found
  in the `GasInfo` type which is always returned regardless of execution outcome.
  * Note to developers: Since all handlers and queriers must now return a standard `error`, the `types/errors/`
  package contains all the relevant and pre-registered errors that you typically work with. A typical
  error returned will look like `sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrUnknownRequest, "...")`. You can retrieve
  relevant ABCI information from the error via `ABCIInfo`.
* (client) [\#5442](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5442) Remove client/alias.go as it's not necessary and
components can be imported directly from the packages.
* (store) [\#4748](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/4748) The `CommitMultiStore` interface
now requires a `SetInterBlockCache` method. Applications that do not wish to support this can simply
have this method perform a no-op.
* (modules) [\#4665](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4665) Refactored `x/gov` module structure and dev-UX:
  * Prepare for module spec integration
  * Update gov keys to use big endian encoding instead of little endian
* (modules) [\#5017](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5017) The `x/genaccounts` module has been deprecated and all components removed except the `legacy/` package.
* [\#4486](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4486) Vesting account types decoupled from the `x/auth` module and now live under `x/auth/vesting`. Applications wishing to use vesting account types must be sure to register types via `RegisterCodec` under the new vesting package.
* [\#4486](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4486) The `NewBaseVestingAccount` constructor returns an error
if the provided arguments are invalid.
* (x/auth) [\#5006](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5006) Modular `AnteHandler` via composable decorators:
  * The `AnteHandler` interface now returns `(newCtx Context, err error)` instead of `(newCtx Context, result sdk.Result, abort bool)`
  * The `NewAnteHandler` function returns an `AnteHandler` function that returns the new `AnteHandler`
  interface and has been moved into the `auth/ante` directory.
  * `ValidateSigCount`, `ValidateMemo`, `ProcessPubKey`, `EnsureSufficientMempoolFee`, and `GetSignBytes`
  have all been removed as public functions.
  * Invalid Signatures may return `InvalidPubKey` instead of `Unauthorized` error, since the transaction
  will first hit `SetPubKeyDecorator` before the `SigVerificationDecorator` runs.
  * `StdTx#GetSignatures` will return an array of just signature byte slices `[][]byte` instead of
  returning an array of `StdSignature` structs. To replicate the old behavior, use the public field
  `StdTx.Signatures` to get back the array of StdSignatures `[]StdSignature`.
* (modules) [\#5299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5299) `HandleDoubleSign` along with params `MaxEvidenceAge` and `DoubleSignJailEndTime` have moved from the `x/slashing` module to the `x/evidence` module.
* (keys) [\#4941](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4941) Keybase concrete types constructors such as `NewKeyBaseFromDir` and `NewInMemory` now accept optional parameters of type `KeybaseOption`. These
optional parameters are also added on the keys sub-commands functions, which are now public, and allows
these options to be set on the commands or ignored to default to previous behavior.
* [\#5547](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5547) `NewKeyBaseFromHomeFlag` constructor has been removed.
* [\#5439](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5439) Further modularization was done to the `keybase`
package to make it more suitable for use with different key formats and algorithms:
  * The `WithKeygenFunc` function added as a `KeybaseOption` which allows a custom bytes to key
    implementation to be defined when keys are created.
  * The `WithDeriveFunc` function added as a `KeybaseOption` allows custom logic for deriving a key
    from a mnemonic, bip39 password, and HD Path.
  * BIP44 is no longer build into `keybase.CreateAccount()`. It is however the default when using
    the `client/keys` add command.
  * `SupportedAlgos` and `SupportedAlgosLedger` functions return a slice of `SigningAlgo`s that are
    supported by the keybase and the ledger integration respectively.
* (simapp) [\#5419](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5419) The `helpers.GenTx()` now accepts a gas argument.
* (baseapp) [\#5455](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5455) A `sdk.Context` is now passed into the `router.Route()` function.

### Client Breaking Changes

* (rest) [\#5270](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5270) All account types now implement custom JSON serialization.
* (rest) [\#4783](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4783) The balance field in the DelegationResponse type is now sdk.Coin instead of sdk.Int
* (x/auth) [\#5006](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5006) The gas required to pass the `AnteHandler` has
increased significantly due to modular `AnteHandler` support. Increase GasLimit accordingly.
* (rest) [\#5336](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5336) `MsgEditValidator` uses `description` instead of `Description` as a JSON key.
* (keys) [\#5097](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5097) Due to the keybase -> keyring transition, keys need to be migrated. See `keys migrate` command for more info.
* (x/auth) [\#5424](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5424) Drop `decode-tx` command from x/auth/client/cli, duplicate of the `decode` command.

### Features

* (store) [\#5435](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5435) New iterator for paginated requests. Iterator limits DB reads to the range of the requested page.
* (x/evidence) [\#5240](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5240) Initial implementation of the `x/evidence` module.
* (cli) [\#5212](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5212) The `q gov proposals` command now supports pagination.
* (store) [\#4724](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4724) Multistore supports substore migrations upon load. New `rootmulti.Store.LoadLatestVersionAndUpgrade` method in
`Baseapp` supports `StoreLoader` to enable various upgrade strategies. It no
longer panics if the store to load contains substores that we didn't explicitly mount.
* [\#4972](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4972) A `TxResponse` with a corresponding code
and tx hash will be returned for specific Tendermint errors:
  * `CodeTxInMempoolCache`
  * `CodeMempoolIsFull`
  * `CodeTxTooLarge`
* [\#3872](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3872) Implement a RESTful endpoint and cli command to decode transactions.
* (keys) [\#4754](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/4754) Introduce new Keybase implementation that can
leverage operating systems' built-in functionalities to securely store secrets. MacOS users may encounter
the following [issue](https://github.com/keybase/go-keychain/issues/47) with the `go-keychain` library. If
you encounter this issue, you must upgrade your xcode command line tools to version >= `10.2`. You can
upgrade via: `sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools; xcode-select --install`. Verify the
correct version via: `pkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables`.
* [\#5355](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5355) Client commands accept a new `--keyring-backend` option through which users can specify which backend should be used
by the new key store:
  * `os`: use OS default credentials storage (default).
  * `file`: use encrypted file-based store.
  * `kwallet`: use [KDE Wallet](https://utils.kde.org/projects/kwalletmanager/) service.
  * `pass`: use the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) command line password manager.
  * `test`: use password-less key store. *For testing purposes only. Use it at your own risk.*
* (keys) [\#5097](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5097) New `keys migrate` command to assist users migrate their keys
to the new keyring.
* (keys) [\#5366](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5366) `keys list` now accepts a `--list-names` option to list key names only, whilst the `keys delete`
command can delete multiple keys by passing their names as arguments. The aforementioned commands can then be piped together, e.g.
`appcli keys list -n | xargs appcli keys delete`
* (modules) [\#4233](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/4233) Add upgrade module that coordinates software upgrades of live chains.
* [\#4486](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4486) Introduce new `PeriodicVestingAccount` vesting account type
that allows for arbitrary vesting periods.
* (baseapp) [\#5196](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5196) Baseapp has a new `runTxModeReCheck` to allow applications to skip expensive and unnecessary re-checking of transactions.
* (types) [\#5196](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5196) Context has new `IsRecheckTx() bool` and `WithIsReCheckTx(bool) Context` methods to to be used in the `AnteHandler`.
* (x/auth/ante) [\#5196](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5196) AnteDecorators have been updated to avoid unnecessary checks when `ctx.IsReCheckTx() == true`
* (x/auth) [\#5006](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5006) Modular `AnteHandler` via composable decorators:
  * The `AnteDecorator` interface has been introduced to allow users to implement modular `AnteHandler`
  functionality that can be composed together to create a single `AnteHandler` rather than implementing
  a custom `AnteHandler` completely from scratch, where each `AnteDecorator` allows for custom behavior in
  tightly defined and logically isolated manner. These custom `AnteDecorator` can then be chained together
  with default `AnteDecorator` or third-party `AnteDecorator` to create a modularized `AnteHandler`
  which will run each `AnteDecorator` in the order specified in `ChainAnteDecorators`. For details
  on the new architecture, refer to the [ADR](docs/architecture/adr-010-modular-antehandler.md).
  * `ChainAnteDecorators` function has been introduced to take in a list of `AnteDecorators` and chain
  them in sequence and return a single `AnteHandler`:
    * `SetUpContextDecorator`: Sets `GasMeter` in context and creates defer clause to recover from any
    `OutOfGas` panics in future AnteDecorators and return `OutOfGas` error to `BaseApp`. It MUST be the
    first `AnteDecorator` in the chain for any application that uses gas (or another one that sets the gas meter).
    * `ValidateBasicDecorator`: Calls tx.ValidateBasic and returns any non-nil error.
    * `ValidateMemoDecorator`: Validates tx memo with application parameters and returns any non-nil error.
    * `ConsumeGasTxSizeDecorator`: Consumes gas proportional to the tx size based on application parameters.
    * `MempoolFeeDecorator`: Checks if fee is above local mempool `minFee` parameter during `CheckTx`.
    * `DeductFeeDecorator`: Deducts the `FeeAmount` from first signer of the transaction.
    * `SetPubKeyDecorator`: Sets pubkey of account in any account that does not already have pubkey saved in state machine.
    * `SigGasConsumeDecorator`: Consume parameter-defined amount of gas for each signature.
    * `SigVerificationDecorator`: Verify each signature is valid, return if there is an error.
    * `ValidateSigCountDecorator`: Validate the number of signatures in tx based on app-parameters.
    * `IncrementSequenceDecorator`: Increments the account sequence for each signer to prevent replay attacks.
* (cli) [\#5223](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5223) Cosmos Ledger App v2.0.0 is now supported. The changes are backwards compatible and App v1.5.x is still supported.
* (x/staking) [\#5380](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5380) Introduced ability to store historical info entries in staking keeper, allows applications to introspect specified number of past headers and validator sets
  * Introduces new parameter `HistoricalEntries` which allows applications to determine how many recent historical info entries they want to persist in store. Default value is 0.
  * Introduces cli commands and rest routes to query historical information at a given height
* (modules) [\#5249](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5249) Funds are now allowed to be directly sent to the community pool (via the distribution module account).
* (keys) [\#4941](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4941) Introduce keybase option to allow overriding the default private key implementation of a key generated through the `keys add` cli command.
* (keys) [\#5439](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5439) Flags `--algo` and `--hd-path` are added to
  `keys add` command in order to make use of keybase modularized. By default, it uses (0, 0) bip44
  HD path and secp256k1 keys, so is non-breaking.
* (types) [\#5447](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5447) Added `ApproxRoot` function to sdk.Decimal type in order to get the nth root for a decimal number, where n is a positive integer.
  * An `ApproxSqrt` function was also added for convenience around the common case of n=2.

### Improvements

* (iavl) [\#5538](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5538) Remove manual IAVL pruning in favor of IAVL's internal pruning strategy.
* (server) [\#4215](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4215) The `--pruning` flag
has been moved to the configuration file, to allow easier node configuration.
* (cli) [\#5116](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5116) The `CLIContext` now supports multiple verifiers
when connecting to multiple chains. The connecting chain's `CLIContext` will have to have the correct
chain ID and node URI or client set. To use a `CLIContext` with a verifier for another chain:
  ```go
  // main or parent chain (chain as if you're running without IBC)
  mainCtx := context.NewCLIContext()

  // connecting IBC chain
  sideCtx := context.NewCLIContext().
    WithChainID(sideChainID).
    WithNodeURI(sideChainNodeURI) // or .WithClient(...)

  sideCtx = sideCtx.WithVerifier(
    context.CreateVerifier(sideCtx, context.DefaultVerifierCacheSize),
  )
  ```
* (modules) [\#5017](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5017) The `x/auth` package now supports
generalized genesis accounts through the `GenesisAccount` interface.

  Only breaking change is not to support `Value` and `GetValue` as first class calls.
  We do embed ctx.Context() as a raw context.Context instead to be used as you see fit.

  Migration guide:

  ```go
  ctx = ctx.WithValue(contextKeyBadProposal, false)
  ```

  Now becomes:

  ```go
  ctx = ctx.WithContext(context.WithValue(ctx.Context(), contextKeyBadProposal, false))
  ```

  A bit more verbose, but also allows `context.WithTimeout()`, etc and only used
  in one function in this repo, in test code.
* [\#3685](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3685)  Add `SetAddressVerifier` and `GetAddressVerifier` to `sdk.Config` to allow SDK users to configure custom address format verification logic (to override the default limitation of 20-byte addresses).
* [\#3685](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3685)  Add an additional parameter to NewAnteHandler for a custom `SignatureVerificationGasConsumer` (the default logic is now in `DefaultSigVerificationGasConsumer). This allows SDK users to configure their own logic for which key types are accepted and how those key types consume gas.
* Remove `--print-response` flag as it is no longer used.
* Revert [\#2284](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/2284) to allow create_empty_blocks in the config
* (tendermint) [\#4718](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4718) Upgrade tendermint/iavl to v0.12.3

    * All txs that used to sign or use the Keybase now only generate the tx
    * `keys` routes completely removed
  * [\#3692](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3692) Update tx encoding and broadcasting endpoints:
    * Remove duplicate broadcasting endpoints in favor of POST @ `/txs`

    * Move encoding endpoint to `/txs/encode`

* Gaia
  * [\#3787](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3787) Fork the `x/bank` module into the Gaia application with only a

            been slashed (from a fault committed by a different validator)
           in the same BeginBlock. Outstanding rewards are now available
           on a per-validator basis in REST.

  * merkleeyes no longers spams the logs... unless you want it
    * Example: `basecoin start --log_level="merkleeyes:info,state:info,*:error"`
    * Example: `basecoin start --log_level="merkleeyes:debug,state:info,*:error"`
* basecli
  * `basecli init` is more intelligent and only complains if there really was
    a connected chain, not just random files
  * support `localhost:46657` or `http://localhost:46657` format for nodes,
    not just `tcp://localhost:46657`
  * Add `--genesis` to init to specify chain-id and validator hash
    * Example: `basecli init --node=localhost:46657 --genesis=$HOME/.basecoin/genesis.json`
  * `basecli rpc` has a number of methods to easily accept tendermint rpc, and verifies what it can

BUG FIXES:

* basecli
  * `basecli query account` accepts hex account address with or without `0x`
    prefix
  * gives error message when running commands on an unitialized chain, rather
    than some unintelligable panic

## 0.6.0 (June 22, 2017)

Make the basecli command the only way to use client-side, to enforce best
security practices. Lots of enhancements to get it up to production quality.

BREAKING CHANGES:

* ./cmd/commands -> ./cmd/basecoin/commands
* basecli
  * `basecli proof state get` -> `basecli query key`
  * `basecli proof tx get` -> `basecli query tx`
  * `basecli proof state get --app=account` -> `basecli query account`
  * use `--chain-id` not `--chainid` for consistency
  * update to use `--trace` not `--debug` for stack traces on errors
  * complete overhaul on how tx and query subcommands are added. (see counter or trackomatron for examples)
  * no longer supports counter app (see new countercli)
* basecoin
  * `basecoin init` takes an argument, an address to allocate funds to in the genesis
  * removed key2.json
  * removed all client side functionality from it (use basecli now for proofs)
    * no tx subcommand
    * no query subcommand
    * no account (query) subcommand
    * a few other random ones...
  * enhanced relay subcommand
    * relay start did what relay used to do
    * relay init registers both chains on one another (to set it up so relay start just works)
* docs
  * removed `example-plugin`, put `counter` inside `docs/guide`
* app
  * Implements ABCI handshake by proxying merkleeyes.Info()

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `basecoin init` support `--chain-id`
* intergrates tendermint 0.10.0 (not the rc-2, but the real thing)
* commands return error code (1) on failure for easier script testing
* add `reset_all` to basecli, and never delete keys on `init`
* new shutil based unit tests, with better coverage of the cli actions
* just `make fresh` when things are getting stale ;)

BUG FIXES:

* app: no longer panics on missing app_options in genesis (thanks, anton)
* docs: updated all docs... again
* ibc: fix panic on getting BlockID from commit without 100% precommits (still a TODO)

## 0.5.2 (June 2, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* fix parsing of the log level from Tendermint config (#97)

## 0.5.1 (May 30, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* fix ibc demo app to use proper tendermint flags, 0.10.0-rc2 compatibility
* Make sure all cli uses new json.Marshal not wire.JSONBytes

## 0.5.0 (May 27, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* only those related to the tendermint 0.9 -> 0.10 upgrade

IMPROVEMENTS:

* basecoin cli
  * integrates tendermint 0.10.0 and unifies cli (init, unsafe_reset_all, ...)
  * integrate viper, all command line flags can also be defined in environmental variables or config.toml
* genesis file
  * you can define accounts with either address or pub_key
  * sorts coins for you, so no silent errors if not in alphabetical order
* [light-client](https://github.com/tendermint/light-client) integration
  * no longer must you trust the node you connect to, prove everything!
  * new [basecli command](./cmd/basecli/README.md)
  * integrated [key management](https://github.com/tendermint/go-crypto/blob/master/cmd/README.md), stored encrypted locally
  * tracks validator set changes and proves everything from one initial validator seed
  * `basecli proof state` gets complete proofs for any abci state
  * `basecli proof tx` gets complete proof where a tx was stored in the chain
  * `basecli proxy` exposes tendermint rpc, but only passes through results after doing complete verification

BUG FIXES:

* no more silently ignored error with invalid coin names (eg. "17.22foo coin" used to parse as "17 foo", not warning/error)

## 0.4.1 (April 26, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* Fix bug in `basecoin unsafe_reset_X` where the `priv_validator.json` was not being reset

## 0.4.0 (April 21, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* CLI now uses Cobra, which forced changes to some of the flag names and orderings

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `basecoin init` doesn't generate error if already initialized
* Much more testing

## 0.3.1 (March 23, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* CLI returns exit code 1 and logs error before exiting

## 0.3.0 (March 23, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Remove `--data` flag and use `BCHOME` to set the home directory (defaults to `~/.basecoin`)
* Remove `--in-proc` flag and start Tendermint in-process by default (expect Tendermint files in $BCHOME/tendermint).
  To start just the ABCI app/server, use `basecoin start --without-tendermint`.
* Consolidate genesis files so the Basecoin genesis is an object under `app_options` in Tendermint genesis. For instance:

```
{
  "app_hash": "",
  "chain_id": "foo_bar_chain",
  "genesis_time": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "validators": [
    {
      "amount": 10,
      "name": "",
      "pub_key": [
	1,
	"7B90EA87E7DC0C7145C8C48C08992BE271C7234134343E8A8E8008E617DE7B30"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "app_options": {
    "accounts": [{
      "pub_key": {
        "type": "ed25519",
        "data": "6880db93598e283a67c4d88fc67a8858aa2de70f713fe94a5109e29c137100c2"
      },
      "coins": [
        {
          "denom": "blank",
          "amount": 12345
        },
        {
          "denom": "ETH",
          "amount": 654321
        }
      ]
    }],
    "plugin_options": ["plugin1/key1", "value1", "plugin1/key2", "value2"]
  }
}
```

Note the array of key-value pairs is now under `app_options.plugin_options` while the `app_options` themselves are well formed.
We also changed `chainID` to `chain_id` and consolidated to have just one of them.

FEATURES:

* Introduce `basecoin init` and `basecoin unsafe_reset_all`

## 0.2.0 (March 6, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Update to ABCI v0.4.0 and Tendermint v0.9.0
* Coins are specified on the CLI as `Xcoin`, eg. `5gold`
* `Cost` is now `Fee`

FEATURES:

* CLI for sending transactions and querying the state,
  designed to be easily extensible as plugins are implemented
* Run Basecoin in-process with Tendermint
* Add `/account` path in Query
* IBC plugin for InterBlockchain Communication
* Demo script of IBC between two chains

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Use new Tendermint `/commit` endpoint for crafting IBC transactions
* More unit tests
* Use go-crypto S structs and go-data for more standard JSON
* Demo uses fewer sleeps

BUG FIXES:

* Various little fixes in coin arithmetic
* More commit validation in IBC
* Return results from transactions
