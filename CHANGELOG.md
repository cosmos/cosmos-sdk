<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking Protobuf, gRPC and REST routes used by end-users.
"CLI Breaking" for breaking CLI commands.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

* (server) [#15041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15041) Refactor how gRPC and API servers are started to remove unnecessary sleeps:
    * `api.Server#Start` now accepts a `context.Context`. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the context is canceled such that the API server can gracefully exit. The caller does not need to stop the server.
    * To start the gRPC server you must first create the server via `NewGRPCServer`, after which you can start the gRPC server via `StartGRPCServer` which accepts a `context.Context`. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the context is canceled such that the gRPC server can gracefully exit. The caller does not need to stop the server.
    * Rename `WaitForQuitSignals` to `ListenForQuitSignals`. Note, this function is no longer blocking. Thus the caller is expected to provide a `context.CancelFunc` which indicates that when a signal is caught, that any spawned processes can gracefully exit.
    * Remove `ServerStartTime` constant.
* [#15011](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15011) All functions that were taking a CometBFT logger, now take `cosmossdk.io/log.Logger` instead.

* (x/evidence) [14724](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14724) Extract Evidence in its own go.mod and rename the package to `cosmossdk.io/x/evidence`.
* (crypto/keyring) [#13734](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13834) The keyring's `Sign` method now takes a new `signMode` argument. It is only used if the signing key is a Ledger hardware device. You can set it to 0 in all other cases.
* (snapshots) [14048](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14048) Move the Snapshot package to the store package. This is done in an effort group all storage related logic under one package.

* (grpc-web) [#14652](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14652) Use same port for gRPC-Web and the API server.

### CLI Breaking Changes

* (all) The migration of modules to [AutoCLI](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/core/autocli) led to no changes in UX but a [small change in CLI outputs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/16651) where results can be nested.
* (all) Query pagination flags have been renamed with the migration to AutoCLI:
    * `--reverse` -> `--page-reverse`
    * `--offset` -> `--page-offset`
    * `--limit` -> `--page-limit`
    * `--count-total` -> `--page-count-total`
* (cli) [#17184](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/17184) All json keys returned by the `status` command are now snake case instead of pascal case.
* (server) [#17177](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/17177) Remove `iavl-lazy-loading` configuration.
* (x/gov) [#16987](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16987) In `<appd> query gov proposals` the proposal status flag have renamed from `--status` to `--proposal-status`. Additionally, that flags now uses the ENUM values: `PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_FAILED`.
* (x/bank) [#16899](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16899) With the migration to AutoCLI some bank commands have been split in two:
    * Use `total-supply` (or `total`) for querying the total supply and `total-supply-of` for querying the supply of a specific denom.
    * Use `denoms-metadata` for querying all denom metadata and `denom-metadata` for querying a specific denom metadata.
* (rosetta) [#16276](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/16276) Rosetta migration to standalone repo.
* (cli) [#15826](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15826) Remove `<appd> q account` command. Use `<appd> q auth account` instead.
* (cli) [#15299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15299) Remove `--amino` flag from `sign` and `multi-sign` commands. Amino `StdTx` has been deprecated for a while. Amino JSON signing still works as expected.
* (x/gov) [#14880](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14880) Remove `<app> tx gov submit-legacy-proposal cancel-software-upgrade` and `software-upgrade` commands. These commands are now in the `x/upgrade` module and using gov v1. Use `tx upgrade software-upgrade` instead.
* (x/staking) [#14864](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14864) `<appd> tx staking create-validator` CLI command now takes a json file as an arg instead of using required flags.
* (cli) [#14659](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14659) `<app> q block <height>` is removed as it just output json. The new command allows either height/hash and is `<app> q block --type=height|hash <height|hash>`.
* (grpc-web) [#14652](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14652) Remove `grpc-web.address` flag.
* (client) [#14342](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14342) `<app> config` command is now a sub-command using Confix. Use `<app> config --help` to learn more.
