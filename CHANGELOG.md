<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking Protobuf, gRPC and REST routes used by end-users.
"CLI Breaking" for breaking CLI commands.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

    * `api.Server#Start` now accepts a `context.Context`. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the context is canceled such that the API server can gracefully exit. The caller does not need to stop the server.
    * To start the gRPC server you must first create the server via `NewGRPCServer`, after which you can start the gRPC server via `StartGRPCServer` which accepts a `context.Context`. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the context is canceled such that the gRPC server can gracefully exit. The caller does not need to stop the server.

* (store) [#14746](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14746) Extract Store in its own go.mod and rename the package to `cosmossdk.io/store`.
* (simulation) [#14751](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14751) Remove the `MsgType` field from `simulation.OperationInput` struct.
* (crypto/keyring) [#13734](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13834) The keyring's `Sign` method now takes a new `signMode` argument. It is only used if the signing key is a Ledger hardware device. You can set it to 0 in all other cases.

* (store/streaming) [#15519](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15519/files) State Streaming removed emitting of beginblock, endblock and delivertx in favour of emitting FinalizeBlock. 

### CLI Breaking Changes

* (cli) The majority of Cosmos SDK modules now use [AutoCLI](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/autocli) for their queries. Allowing for a more consistent CLI experience between modules and CLI and gRPC. These changes led to no changes in UX but a [small change in CLI outputs for some commands returning a JSON or a YAML](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/16651).
* (cli) [#15826](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15826) Remove `<appd> q account` command. Use `<appd> q auth account` instead.
* (x/staking) [#14864](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14864) `create-validator` CLI command now takes a json file as an arg instead of having a bunch of required flags to it.
* (cli) [#14659](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14659) `<app> q block <height>` is removed as it just output json. The new command allows either height/hash and is `<app> q block --type=height|hash <height|hash>`. 
* (x/gov) [#14880](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14880) Remove `<app> tx gov submit-legacy-proposal cancel-software-upgrade` and `software-upgrade` commands. These commands are now in the `x/upgrade` module and using gov v1. Use `tx upgrade software-upgrade` instead.
* (grpc-web) [#14652](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14652) Remove `grpc-web.address` flag.
* (client) [#14342](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14342) `<app> config` command is now a sub-command. Use `<app> config --help` to learn more.
* (cli) [#15299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15299) Remove `--amino` flag from `sign` and `multi-sign` commands. Amino `StdTx` has been deprecated for a while. Amino JSON signing still works as expected. 

### Bug Fixes

* (baseapp) [#16259](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16259) Ensure the `Context` block height is correct after `InitChain` and prior to the second block.
* (x/staking) [#16043](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16043) Call `AfterUnbondingInitiated` hook for new unbonding entries only and fix `UnbondingDelegation` entries handling. This is a behavior change compared to Cosmos SDK v0.47.x, now the hook is called only for new unbonding entries.

* (types/coin) [#14739](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14739) Deprecate the method `Coin.IsEqual` in favour of  `Coin.Equal`. The difference between the two methods is that the first one results in a panic when denoms are not equal. This panic lead to unexpected behavior
* (x/crypto) [#15258](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15258) Write keyhash file with permissions 0600 instead of 0555.
* (cli) [#16138](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16138) Fix snapshot commands panic if snapshot don't exists.
* (x/gov) [#16230](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16231) Fix: rawlog JSON formatting of proposal_vote option field

### Deprecated

* (x/staking) [#14567](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14567) The `delegator_address` field of `MsgCreateValidator` has been deprecated.
   The validator address bytes and delegator address bytes refer to the same account while creating validator (defer only in bech32 notation).

### API Breaking Changes

* (testutil) [#14991](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14991) The `testutil/testdata_pulsar` package has moved to `testutil/testdata/testpb`.  Chains will not notice this breaking change as this package contains testing utilities only used by the SDK internally.

## [v0.47.2](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.2) - 2023-04-27

In contexts where the block timestamp is needed for previous states, the timestamp will now be set.

Otherwise, the block timestamp will be populated for heights going forward once upgraded.

* (x/modules) Remove all LegacyQueries and related code from modules
* (store) [#11825](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11825) Make extension snapshotter interface safer to use, renamed the util function `WriteExtensionItem` to `WriteExtensionPayload`.
* (x/genutil)[#12956](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/12956) `genutil.AppModuleBasic` has a new attribute: genesis transaction validation function. The existing validation logic is implemented in `genutiltypes.DefaultMessageValidator`. Use `genutil.NewAppModuleBasic` to create a new genutil Module Basic.
* (codec) [#12964](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/12964) `ProtoCodec.MarshalInterface` now returns an error when serializing unregistered types and a subsequent `ProtoCodec.UnmarshalInterface` would fail.
* (x/staking) [#12973](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/12973) Removed `stakingkeeper.RandomValidator`. Use `testutil.RandSliceElem(r, sk.GetAllValidators(ctx))` instead.
* (x/gov) [#13160](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13160) Remove custom marshaling of proposl and voteoption.
* (types) [#13430](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13430) Remove unused code `ResponseCheckTx` and `ResponseDeliverTx`
* (store) [#13529](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13529) Add method `LatestVersion` to `MultiStore` interface, add method `SetQueryMultiStore` to baesapp to support alternative `MultiStore` implementation for query service.
* (pruning) [#13609](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13609) Move pruning package to be under store package
* [#13794](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13794) Most methods on `types/module.AppModule` have been moved to 
extension interfaces. `module.Manager.Modules` is now of type `map[string]interface{}` to support in parallel the new 
`cosmossdk.io/core/appmodule.AppModule` API.

### CLI Breaking Changes

* (genesis) [#14149](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14149) Add `simd genesis` command, which contains all genesis-related sub-commands.
* (x/genutil) [#13535](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13535) Replace in `simd init`, the `--staking-bond-denom` flag with `--default-denom` which is used for all default denomination in the genesis, instead of only staking.
