<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry is required to include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The tag should consist of where the change is being made ex. (x/staking), (store)
The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking Protobuf, gRPC and REST routes used by end-users.
"CLI Breaking" for breaking CLI commands.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

* (client) [#20255](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20255) Use comet proofOp proto type instead of sdk version to avoid needing to translate to later be proven in the merkle proof runtime. 
* (types)[#20369](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20369) The signature of `HasAminoCodec` has changed to accept a `core/legacy.Amino` interface instead of `codec.LegacyAmino`.
* (server) [#20422](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20422) Deprecated `ServerContext`. To get `cmtcfg.Config` from cmd, use `client.GetCometConfigFromCmd(cmd)` instead of `server.GetServerContextFromCmd(cmd).Config`
* (x/genutil) [#20740](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20740) Update `genutilcli.Commands` and `genutilcli.CommandsWithCustomMigrationMap` to take the genesis module and abstract the module manager.
* (types/errors) [#20756](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20756) Remove `ResponseCheckTxWithEvents`, `ResponseExecTxResultWithEvents` & `QueryResult` from types/errors pkg. They have been moved to `baseapp/errors.go` and made private.
* (client) [#20976](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20976) Simplified command initialization by removing unnecessary parameters such as `txConfig` and `addressCodec`.
    * Remove parameter `txConfig` from `genutilcli.Commands`,`genutilcli.CommandsWithCustomMigrationMap`,`genutilcli.GenTxCmd`.
    * Remove parameter `addressCodec` from `genutilcli.GenTxCmd`,`genutilcli.AddGenesisAccountCmd`,`stakingcli.BuildCreateValidatorMsg`.
* (sims) [#21039](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21039): Remove Baseapp from sims by a new interface `simtypes.AppEntrypoint`.
* (x/genutil) [#21372](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21372) Remove `AddGenesisAccount` for `AddGenesisAccounts`.
* (baseapp) [#21413](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21413) Add `SelectBy` method to `Mempool` interface, which is thread-safe to use.
* (types/mempool) [#21744](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21744) Update types/mempool.Mempool interface to take decoded transactions. This avoid to decode the transaction twice.
* (x/auth/tx/config)  [#21822](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21822) Sign mode textual is no more automatically added to tx config when using runtime. Should be added manually on the server side.
* (x/auth/tx/config)  [#21822](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21822) This depinject module now only provide txconfig and tx config options. `x/validate` now handles the providing of ante/post handlers, alongside tx validators for v2. The corresponding app config options have been removed from the depinject module config.
* (x/crisis) [#20809](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20809) Crisis module was removed from the Cosmos SDK.
* (client) [#22775](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/22775) Removed client prompt validations.

### Client Breaking Changes

* (runtime) [#19040](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19040) Simplify app config implementation and deprecate `/cosmos/app/v1alpha1/config` query. 

### CLI Breaking Changes

* (server) [#18303](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18303) `appd export` has moved with other genesis commands, use `appd genesis export` instead.
* (perf)[#20490](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20490) Sims: Replace runsim command with Go stdlib testing. CLI: `Commit` default true, `Lean`, `SimulateEveryOperation`, `PrintAllInvariants`, `DBBackend` params removed
* (client/tx) [#20870](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20870) Removed `timeout-height` flag replace with `timeout-timestamp` flag for a time based timeout.

### Deprecated

* (simapp) [#19146](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19146) Replace `--v` CLI option with `--validator-count`/`-n`.
* (module) [#19370](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19370) Deprecate `module.Configurator`, use `appmodule.HasMigrations` and `appmodule.HasServices` instead from Core API.
* (types) [#21435](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21435) The `String()` method on `AccAddress`, `ValAddress` and `ConsAddress` have been deprecated. This is done because those are still using the deprecated global `sdk.Config`. Use an `address.Codec` instead.
