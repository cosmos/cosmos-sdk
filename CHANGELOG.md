<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry is required to include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The tag should consist of where the change is being made ex. (x/staking), (store)
The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking Protobuf, gRPC and REST routes used by end-users.
"CLI Breaking" for breaking CLI commands.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

See `DefaultPriorityNonceMempoolConfig` for how to construct the configuration and a `TxPriority` type.
* [#15299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15299) Remove `StdTx` transaction and signing APIs. No SDK version has actually supported `StdTx` since before Stargate.
* [#15284](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15284)
* (x/gov) [#15284](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15284) `NewKeeper` now requires `codec.Codec`.
* (x/authx) [#15284](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15284) `NewKeeper` now requires `codec.Codec`.
    * `types/tx.Tx` no longer implements `sdk.Tx`.
    * `sdk.Tx` now requires a new method `GetMsgsV2()`.
    * `sdk.Msg.GetSigners` was deprecated and is no longer supported. Use the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` protobuf annotation instead.
    * `TxConfig` has a new method `SigningContext() *signing.Context`.
    * `SigVerifiableTx.GetSigners()` now returns `([][]byte, error)` instead of `[]sdk.AccAddress`.
    * `AccountKeeper` now has an `AddressCodec() address.Codec` method and the expected `AccountKeeper` for `x/auth/ante` expects this method.
* [#15211](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15211) Remove usage of `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/libs/bytes.HexBytes` in favor of `[]byte` thorough the SDK.

* (types) [#15067](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15067) Remove deprecated alias from `types/errors`. Use `cosmossdk.io/errors` instead.
* (server) [#15041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15041) Refactor how gRPC and API servers are started to remove unnecessary sleeps:
    * `api.Server#Start` now accepts a `context.Context`. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the context is canceled such that the API server can gracefully exit. The caller does not need to stop the server.
    * To start the gRPC server you must first create the server via `NewGRPCServer`, after which you can start the gRPC server via `StartGRPCServer` which accepts a `context.Context`. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the context is canceled such that the gRPC server can gracefully exit. The caller does not need to stop the server.
    * Rename `WaitForQuitSignals` to `ListenForQuitSignals`. Note, this function is no longer blocking. Thus the caller is expected to provide a `context.CancelFunc` which indicates that when a signal is caught, that any spawned processes can gracefully exit.
    * Remove `ServerStartTime` constant.
* [#15011](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15011) All functions that were taking a CometBFT logger, now take `cosmossdk.io/log.Logger` instead.
* (simapp) [#14977](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14977) Move simulation helpers functions (`AppStateFn` and `AppStateRandomizedFn`) to `testutil/sims`. These takes an extra genesisState argument which is the default state of the app.
* (x/bank) [#14894](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14894) Allow a human readable denomination for coins when querying bank balances. Added a `ResolveDenom` parameter to `types.QueryAllBalancesRequest`.
* [#14847](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14847) App and ModuleManager methods `InitGenesis`, `ExportGenesis`, `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` now also return an error.
* (x/upgrade) [#14764](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14764) The `x/upgrade` module is extracted to have a separate go.mod file which allows it to be a standalone module. 
* (x/auth) [#14758](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14758) Refactor transaction searching:
    * Refactor `QueryTxsByEvents` to accept a `query` of type `string` instead of `events` of type `[]string`
    * Refactor CLI methods to accept `--query` flag instead of `--events`
    * Pass `prove=false` to Tendermint's `TxSearch` RPC method

* (tx) [#14634](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14634) Move the `tx` go module to `x/tx`.
* (store/streaming)[#14603](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14603) `StoreDecoderRegistry` moved from store to `types/simulations` this breaks the `AppModuleSimulation` interface. 
* (snapshots) [#14597](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14597) Move `snapshots` to `store/snapshots`, rename and bump proto package to v1.
* (x/staking) [#14590](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14590) `MsgUndelegateResponse` now includes undelegated amount. `x/staking` module's `keeper.Undelegate` now returns 3 values (completionTime,undelegateAmount,error)  instead of 2.
* (crypto/keyring) [#14151](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14151) Move keys presentation from `crypto/keyring` to `client/keys`

* (x/evidence) [14724](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14724) Extract Evidence in its own go.mod and rename the package to `cosmossdk.io/x/evidence`.
* (crypto/keyring) [#13734](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13834) The keyring's `Sign` method now takes a new `signMode` argument. It is only used if the signing key is a Ledger hardware device. You can set it to 0 in all other cases.
* (snapshots) [14048](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14048) Move the Snapshot package to the store package. This is done in an effort group all storage related logic under one package.
* (signing) [#13701](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/) Add `context.Context` as an argument `x/auth/signing.VerifySignature`.
* (store) [#11825](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11825) Make extension snapshotter interface safer to use, renamed the util function `WriteExtensionItem` to `WriteExtensionPayload`.

* (grpc-web) [#14652](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14652) Use same port for gRPC-Web and the API server.

### CLI Breaking Changes

* (all) The migration of modules to [AutoCLI](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/core/autocli) led to no changes in UX but a [small change in CLI outputs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/16651) where results can be nested.
* (all) Query pagination flags have been renamed with the migration to AutoCLI:
    * `--reverse` -> `--page-reverse`
    * `--offset` -> `--page-offset`
    * `--limit` -> `--page-limit`
    * `--count-total` -> `--page-count-total`
* (cli) [#17184](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/17184) All json keys returned by the `status` command are now snake case instead of pascal case.
* (server) [#17177](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/17177) Remove `iavl-lazy-loading` configuration.
* (x/gov) [#16987](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16987) In `<appd> query gov proposals` the proposal status flag have renamed from `--status` to `--proposal-status`. Additonally, that flags now uses the ENUM values: `PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED`, `PROPOSAL_STATUS_FAILED`.
* (x/bank) [#16899](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16899) With the migration to AutoCLI some bank commands have been split in two: 
    * Use `total-supply` (or `total`) for querying the total supply and `total-supply-of` for querying the supply of a specific denom. 
    * Use `denoms-metadata` for querying all denom metadata and `denom-metadata` for querying a specific denom metadata.
* (rosetta) [#16276](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/16276) Rosetta migration to standalone repo.
* (cli) [#15826](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15826) Remove `<appd> q account` command. Use `<appd> q auth account` instead.
* (cli) [#15299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15299) Remove `--amino` flag from `sign` and `multi-sign` commands. Amino `StdTx` has been deprecated for a while. Amino JSON signing still works as expected. 
* (x/gov) [#14880](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14880) Remove `<app> tx gov submit-legacy-proposal cancel-software-upgrade` and `software-upgrade` commands. These commands are now in the `x/upgrade` module and using gov v1. Use `tx upgrade software-upgrade` instead.
* (x/staking) [#14864](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14864) `create-validator` CLI command now takes a json file as an arg instead of having a bunch of required flags to it.
* (cli) [#14659](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14659) `<app> q block <height>` is removed as it just output json. The new command allows either height/hash and is `<app> q block --type=height|hash <height|hash>`. 
* (grpc-web) [#14652](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14652) Remove `grpc-web.address` flag.
* (client) [#14342](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/14342) `<app> config` command is now a sub-command. Use `<app> config --help` to learn more.

## [v0.47.2](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.2) - 2023-04-27

### Improvements

* (x/evidence) [#15908](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15908) Update the equivocation handler to work with ICS by removing a pubkey check that was performing a no-op for consumer chains.
* (x/slashing) [#15908](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15908) Remove the validators' pubkey check in the signature handler in order to work with ICS.

* [#15448](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/15448) Automatically populate the block timestamp for historical queries. In contexts where the block timestamp is needed for previous states, the timestamp will now be set. Note, when querying against a node it must be re-synced in order to be able to automatically populate the block timestamp. Otherwise, the block timestamp will be populated for heights going forward once upgraded.
* [#14019](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14019) Remove the interface casting to allow other implementations of a `CommitMultiStore`.

### API Breaking Changes

* (x/auth/ante) [#11985](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11985) The `MempoolFeeDecorator` has been removed. Instead, the `DeductFeeDecorator` takes a new argument of type `TxFeeChecker`, to define custom fee models. If `nil` is passed to this `TxFeeChecker` argument, then it will default to `checkTxFeeWithValidatorMinGasPrices`, which is the exact same behavior as the old `MempoolFeeDecorator` (i.e. checking fees against validator's own min gas price).
* (x/auth/ante) [#11985](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11985) The `ExtensionOptionsDecorator` takes an argument of type `ExtensionOptionChecker`. For backwards-compatibility, you can pass `nil`, which defaults to the old behavior of rejecting all tx extensions.

    * Return:
    _`keyring.Record, error` in `SaveOfflineKey`, `SaveLedgerKey`, `SaveMultiSig`, `Key` and `KeyByAddress`.
    _`keyring.Record` instead of `Info` in `NewMnemonic` and `List`.
    * Remove `algo` argument from :
        * `SaveOfflineKey`
    * Take `keyring.Record` instead of `Info` as first argument in:
        * `MkConsKeyOutput`
        * `MkValKeyOutput`
        * `MkAccKeyOutput`
* [#10022](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10022) `AuthKeeper` interface in `x/auth` now includes a function `HasAccount`.

All users should upgrade immediately.

Users *must* add a replace directive in their go.mod for the new `ics23` package in the SDK:

```go
replace github.com/confio/ics23/go => github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/ics23/go v0.8.0
```

## [v0.44.5](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.5) - 2021-12-02

### Bug Fixes

* [#10648](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10648) Upgrade IAVL to 0.17.3 to solve race condition bug in IAVL.

## [v0.44.4](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.4) - 2021-11-25

### Improvements

* (types) [#10630](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10630) Add an `Events` field to the `TxResponse` type that captures *all* events emitted by a transaction, unlike `Logs` which only contains events emitted during message execution.

* [#8849](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8849) Upgrade module no longer supports time based upgrades.
* [#7477](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7477) Changed Bech32 Public Key serialization in the client facing functionality (CLI, MsgServer, QueryServer):
    * updated the keyring display structure (it uses protobuf JSON serialization) - the output is more verbose.
    * Renamed `MarshalAny` and `UnmarshalAny` to `MarshalInterface` and `UnmarshalInterface` respectively. These functions must take an interface as parameter (not a concrete type nor `Any` object). Underneath they use `Any` wrapping for correct protobuf serialization.
    * CLI: removed `--text` flag from `show-node-id` command; the text format for public keys is not used any more - instead we use ProtoJSON.
* (store) [#8790](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8790) Reduce gas costs by 10x for transient store operations.
* [#9139](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9139) Querying events:

* (x/staking) [#8473](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8473) On genesis init, if non bonded pool and bonded pool balance, coming from the bank module, does not match what is saved in the staking state, the initialization will panic.
* (x/gov) [#8473](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8473) On genesis init, if the gov module account balance, coming from bank module state, does not match the one in gov module state, the initialization will panic.
* (x/distribution) [#8473](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8473) On genesis init, if the distribution module account balance, coming from bank module state, does not match the one in distribution module state, the initialization will panic.
* (client/keys) [#8500](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8500) `InfoImporter` interface is removed from legacy keybase.
* (x/staking) [#8505](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8505) `sdk.PowerReduction` has been renamed to `sdk.DefaultPowerReduction`, and most staking functions relying on power reduction take a new function argument, instead of relying on that global variable.

    * `ValidatorI` interface update: `GetConsPubKey` renamed to `TmConsPubKey` (this is to clarify the return type: consensus public key must be a tendermint key); `TmConsPubKey`, `GetConsAddr` methods return error.
    * `Validator` updated according to the `ValidatorI` changes described above.
    * `ToTmValidator` function: added `error` to return values.
    * `Validator.ConsensusPubkey` type changed from `string` to `codectypes.Any`.
    * `MsgCreateValidator.Pubkey` type changed from `string` to `codectypes.Any`.

* (codec) [#9226](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9226) Rename codec interfaces and methods, to follow a general Go interfaces:
    * `codec.Marshaler` → `codec.Codec` (this defines objects which serialize other objects)
    * `codec.BinaryMarshaler` → `codec.BinaryCodec`

* [#9139](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9139) `ServiceMsg` TypeURLs (e.g. `/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.Msg/Send`) have been removed, as they don't comply to the Probobuf `Any` spec. Please use `Msg` type TypeURLs (e.g. `/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend`). This has multiple consequences:
    * The `sdk.ServiceMsg` struct has been removed.
    * `sdk.Msg` now only contains `ValidateBasic` and `GetSigners` methods. The remaining methods `GetSignBytes`, `Route` and `Type` are moved to `legacytx.LegacyMsg`.

* (x/bank) [#9550](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9550) `server.InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` now takes 2 additional arguments: customAppConfigTemplate and customAppConfig. If you don't need to customize these, simply put `""` and `nil`.
* [#8245](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8245) Removed `simapp.MakeCodecs` and use `simapp.MakeTestEncodingConfig` instead.
* (x/capability) [#9836](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9836) Removed `InitializeAndSeal(ctx sdk.Context)` and replaced with `Seal()`. App must add x/capability module to the begin blockers which will assure that the x/capability keeper is properly initialized. The x/capability begin blocker must be run before any other module which uses x/capability.

* [#9401](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9401) Fixes incorrect export of IBC identifier sequences. Previously, the next identifier sequence for clients/connections/channels was not set during genesis export. This resulted in the next identifiers being generated on the new chain to reuse old identifiers (the sequences began again from 0).
* [#9408](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9408) Update simapp to use correct default broadcast mode.
* [#9513](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9513) Fixes testnet CLI command. Testnet now updates the supply in genesis. Previously, when using add-genesis-account and testnet together, inconsistent genesis files would be produced, as only add-genesis-account was updating the supply.

* **General**
    * (baseapp) [#6384](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6384) The `Result.Data` is now a Protocol Buffer encoded binary blob of type `TxData`. The `TxData` contains `Data` which contains a list of Protocol Buffer encoded message data and the corresponding message type.
    * (client) [#5783](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5783) Unify all coins representations on JSON client requests for governance proposals.
    * (crypto) [#7419](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7419) The SDK doesn't use Tendermint's `crypto.PubKey`
    interface anymore, and uses instead it's own `PubKey` interface, defined in `crypto/types`. Replace all instances of
    `crypto.PubKey` by `cryptotypes.Pubkey`.
    * (store/rootmulti) [#6390](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6390) Proofs of empty stores are no longer supported.
    * (store/types) [#5730](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5730) store.types.Cp() is removed in favour of types.CopyBytes().
    * (x/auth) [#6054](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6054) Remove custom JSON marshaling for base accounts as multsigs cannot be bech32 decoded.
    * (x/auth/vesting) [#6859](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6859) Custom JSON marshaling of vesting accounts was removed. Vesting accounts are now marshaled using their default proto or amino JSON representation.
    * (x/bank) [#5785](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5785) In x/bank errors, JSON strings coerced to valid UTF-8 bytes at JSON marshalling time
    are now replaced by human-readable expressions. This change can potentially break compatibility with all those client side tools
    that parse log messages.
    * (x/evidence) [#7538](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7538) The ABCI's `Result.Data` field for
    `MsgSubmitEvidence` responses does not contain the raw evidence's hash, but the protobuf encoded
    `MsgSubmitEvidenceResponse` struct.
    * (x/gov) [#7533](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7533) The ABCI's `Result.Data` field for
    `MsgSubmitProposal` responses does not contain a raw binary encoding of the `proposalID`, but the protobuf encoded
    `MsgSubmitSubmitProposalResponse` struct.
    * (x/gov) [#6859](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6859) `ProposalStatus` and `VoteOption` are now JSON serialized using its protobuf name, so expect names like `PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD` as opposed to `DepositPeriod`.
    * (x/staking) [#7499](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7499) `BondStatus` is now a protobuf `enum` instead
    of an `int32`, and JSON serialized using its protobuf name, so expect names like `BOND_STATUS_UNBONDING` as opposed
    to `Unbonding`.
    * (x/staking) [#7556](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7556) The ABCI's `Result.Data` field for
    `MsgBeginRedelegate` and `MsgUndelegate` responses does not contain custom binary marshaled `completionTime`, but the
    protobuf encoded `MsgBeginRedelegateResponse` and `MsgUndelegateResponse` structs respectively

### API Breaking Changes

* **Baseapp / Client**
    * (AppModule) [#7518](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7518) [#7584](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7584) Rename `AppModule.RegisterQueryServices` to `AppModule.RegisterServices`, as this method now registers multiple services (the gRPC query service and the protobuf Msg service). A `Configurator` struct is used to hold the different services.
    * (baseapp) [#5865](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5865) The `SimulationResponse` returned from tx simulation is now JSON encoded instead of Amino binary.
    * (client) [#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `CLIContext` is renamed to `Context`. `Context` and all related methods have been moved from package context to client.
    * (client) [#6525](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6525) Removed support for `indent` in JSON responses. Clients should consider piping to an external tool such as `jq`.
    * (client) [#8107](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8107) Renamed `PrintOutput` and `PrintOutputLegacy`
    methods of the `context.Client` object to `PrintProto` and `PrintObjectLegacy`.
    * (client/flags) [#6632](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6632) Remove NewCompletionCmd(), the function is now available in tendermint.
    * (client/input) [#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) Removal of unnecessary `GetCheckPassword`, `PrintPrefixed` functions.
    * (client/keys) [#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) Rename `NewKeyBaseFromDir()` -> `NewLegacyKeyBaseFromDir()`.
    * (client/keys) [#5820](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5820/) Removed method CloseDB from Keybase interface.
    * (client/rpc) [#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `client` package and subdirs reorganization.
    * (client/lcd) [#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `CliCtx` of struct `RestServer` in package client/lcd has been renamed to `ClientCtx`.
    * (codec) [#6330](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6330) `codec.RegisterCrypto` has been moved to the `crypto/codec` package and the global `codec.Cdc` Amino instance has been deprecated and moved to the `codec/legacy_global` package.
    * (codec) [#8080](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8080) Updated the `codec.Marshaler` interface
        * Moved `MarshalAny` and `UnmarshalAny` helper functions to `codec.Marshaler` and renamed to `MarshalInterface` and
      `UnmarshalInterface` respectively. These functions must take interface as a parameter (not a concrete type nor `Any`
      object). Underneath they use `Any` wrapping for correct protobuf serialization.
    * (crypto) [#6780](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6780) Move ledger code to its own package.
    * (crypto/types/multisig) [#6373](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6373) `multisig.Multisignature` has been renamed to `AminoMultisignature`
    * (codec) `*codec.LegacyAmino` is now a wrapper around Amino which provides backwards compatibility with protobuf `Any`. ALL legacy code should use `*codec.LegacyAmino` instead of `*amino.Codec` directly
    * (crypto) [#5880](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5880) Merge `crypto/keys/mintkey` into `crypto`.
    * (crypto/hd) [#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) `crypto/keys/hd` moved to `crypto/hd`.
    * (crypto/keyring):
    _ [#5866](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5866) Rename `crypto/keys/` to `crypto/keyring/`.
    _ [#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) `Keybase` -> `Keyring` interfaces migration. `LegacyKeybase` interface is added in order
    to guarantee limited backward compatibility with the old Keybase interface for the sole purpose of migrating keys across the new keyring backends. `NewLegacy`
    constructor is provided [#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) to allow for smooth migration of keys from the legacy LevelDB based implementation
    to new keyring backends. Plus, the package and the new keyring no longer depends on the sdk.Config singleton. Please consult the [package documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/crypto/keyring/doc.go) for more
    information on how to implement the new `Keyring` interface. \* [#5858](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5858) Make Keyring store keys by name and address's hexbytes representation.
    * (export) [#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) `AppExporter` now returns ABCI consensus parameters to be included in marshaled exported state. These parameters must be returned from the application via the `BaseApp`.

    * (store) [#5803](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5803) The `store.CommitMultiStore` interface now includes the new `snapshots.Snapshotter` interface as well.
    * (types) [#5579](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5579) The `keepRecent` field has been removed from the `PruningOptions` type.
    The `PruningOptions` type now only includes fields `KeepEvery` and `SnapshotEvery`, where `KeepEvery`
    determines which committed heights are flushed to disk and `SnapshotEvery` determines which of these
    heights are kept after pruning. The `IsValid` method should be called whenever using these options. Methods
    `SnapshotVersion` and `FlushVersion` accept a version arugment and determine if the version should be
    flushed to disk or kept as a snapshot. Note, `KeepRecent` is automatically inferred from the options
    and provided directly the IAVL store.
    * (types) [#5533](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5533) Refactored `AppModuleBasic` and `AppModuleGenesis`
    to now accept a `codec.JSONMarshaler` for modular serialization of genesis state.
    * (types/rest) [#5779](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5779) Drop unused Parse{Int64OrReturnBadRequest,QueryParamBool}() functions.
* **Modules**
    * (modules) [#7243](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7243) Rename `RegisterCodec` to `RegisterLegacyAminoCodec` and `codec.New()` is now renamed to `codec.NewLegacyAmino()`

    * (modules) [#6734](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6834) Add `TxEncodingConfig` parameter to `AppModuleBasic.ValidateGenesis` command to support JSON tx decoding in `genutil`.
    * (modules) [#7764](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7764) Added module initialization options:
        * `server/types.AppExporter` requires extra argument: `AppOptions`.
        * `server.AddCommands` requires extra argument: `addStartFlags types.ModuleInitFlags`
        * `x/crisis.NewAppModule` has a new attribute: `skipGenesisInvariants`. [PR](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7764)
    * (types) [#6327](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6327) `sdk.Msg` now inherits `proto.Message`, as a result all `sdk.Msg` types now use pointer semantics.
    * (types) [#7032](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7032) All types ending with `ID` (e.g. `ProposalID`) now end with `Id` (e.g. `ProposalId`), to match default Protobuf generated format. Also see [#7033](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7033) for more details.
    * (x/auth) [#6029](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6029) Module accounts have been moved from `x/supply` to `x/auth`.

    * (x/auth/tx) [#8106](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8106) change related to missing append functionality in
    client transaction signing
        * added `overwriteSig` argument to `x/auth/client.SignTx` and `client/tx.Sign` functions.
        * removed `x/auth/tx.go:wrapper.GetSignatures`. The `wrapper` provides `TxBuilder` functionality, and it's a private
      structure. That function was not used at all and it's not exposed through the `TxBuilder` interface.
    * (x/bank) [#7327](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7327) AddCoins and SubtractCoins no longer return a resultingValue and will only return an error.

    * (x/evidence) [#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Remove APIs for getting and setting `x/evidence` parameters. `BaseApp` now uses a `ParamStore` to manage Tendermint consensus parameters which is managed via the `x/params` `Substore` type.
    * (x/gov) [#6147](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6147) The `Content` field on `Proposal` and `MsgSubmitProposal`
    is now `Any` in concordance with [ADR 019](docs/architecture/adr-019-protobuf-state-encoding.md) and `GetContent` should now
    be used to retrieve the actual proposal `Content`. Also the `NewMsgSubmitProposal` constructor now may return an `error`
    * (x/ibc) [#6374](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6374) `VerifyMembership` and `VerifyNonMembership` now take a `specs []string` argument to specify the proof format used for verification. Most SDK chains can simply use `commitmenttypes.GetSDKSpecs()` for this argument.
    * (x/params) [#5619](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5619) The `x/params` keeper now accepts a `codec.Marshaller` instead of
    a reference to an amino codec. Amino is still used for JSON serialization.
    * (x/staking) [#6451](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6451) `DefaultParamspace` and `ParamKeyTable` in staking module are moved from keeper to types to enforce consistency.
    * (x/staking) [#7419](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7419) The `TmConsPubKey` method on ValidatorI has been
    removed and replaced instead by `ConsPubKey` (which returns a SDK `cryptotypes.PubKey`) and `TmConsPublicKey` (which
    returns a Tendermint proto PublicKey).
    * (x/staking/types) [#7447](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/7447) Remove bech32 PubKey support:
        * `ValidatorI` interface update. `GetConsPubKey` renamed to `TmConsPubKey` (consensus public key must be a tendermint key). `TmConsPubKey`, `GetConsAddr` methods return error.
        * `Validator` update. Methods changed in `ValidatorI` (as described above) and `ToTmValidator` return error.
        * `Validator.ConsensusPubkey` type changed from `string` to `codectypes.Any`.
        * `MsgCreateValidator.Pubkey` type changed from `string` to `codectypes.Any`.
    * (x/supply) [#6010](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6010) All `x/supply` types and APIs have been moved to `x/bank`.
    * [#6409](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6409) Rename all IsEmpty methods to Empty across the codebase and enforce consistency.
    * [#6231](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6231) Simplify `AppModule` interface, `Route` and `NewHandler` methods become only `Route`
    and returns a new `Route` type.
    * (x/slashing) [#6212](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6212) Remove `Get*` prefixes from key construction functions

    Buffers for state serialization instead of Amino.
    _ `MsgSubmitProposal` will be removed in favor of the application-level proto-defined `MsgSubmitProposal` which
    implements the `MsgSubmitProposalI` interface. Applications should extend the `NewMsgSubmitProposalBase` type
    to define their own concrete `MsgSubmitProposal` types.
    _ The module now accepts a `Codec` interface which extends the `codec.Marshaler` interface by

    provided is specified by `ModuleCdc`.
    * (x/staking) [#6844](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6844) Validators are now inserted into the unbonding queue based on their unbonding time and height. The relevant keeper APIs are modified to reflect these changes by now also requiring a height.
    * (x/staking) [#6061](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6061) Allow a validator to immediately unjail when no signing info is present due to
    falling below their minimum self-delegation and never having been bonded. The validator may immediately unjail once they've met their minimum self-delegation.

    * (baseapp) [#5803](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5803) Added support for taking state snapshots at regular height intervals, via options `snapshot-interval` and `snapshot-keep-recent`.
    * (baseapp) [#7519](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7519) Add `ServiceMsgRouter` to BaseApp to handle routing of protobuf service `Msg`s. The two new types defined in ADR 031, `sdk.ServiceMsg` and `sdk.MsgRequest` are introduced with this router.
    * (client) [#5921](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5921) Introduce new gRPC and gRPC Gateway based APIs for querying app & module data. See [ADR021](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-021-protobuf-query-encoding.md) for more details
    * (cli) [#7485](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7485) Introduce a new optional `--keyring-dir` flag that allows clients to specify a Keyring directory if it does not reside in the directory specified by `--home`.
    * (cli) [#7221](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7221) Add the option of emitting amino encoded json from the CLI
    * (codec) [#7519](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7519) `InterfaceRegistry` now inherits `jsonpb.AnyResolver`, and has a `RegisterCustomTypeURL` method to support ADR 031 packing of `Any`s. `AnyResolver` is now a required parameter to `RejectUnknownFields`.
    * (coin) [#6755](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6755) Add custom regex validation for `Coin` denom by overwriting `CoinDenomRegex` when using `/types/coin.go`.
    * (config) [#7265](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7265) Support Tendermint block pruning through a new `min-retain-blocks` configuration that can be set in either `app.toml` or via the CLI. This parameter is used in conjunction with other criteria to determine the height at which Tendermint should prune blocks.
    * (events) [#7121](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7121) The application now derives what events are indexed by Tendermint via the `index-events` configuration in `app.toml`, which is a list of events taking the form `{eventType}.{attributeKey}`.
    * (tx) [#6089](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6089) Transactions can now have a `TimeoutHeight` set which allows the transaction to be rejected if it's committed at a height greater than the timeout.
    * (rest) [#6167](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6167) Support `max-body-bytes` CLI flag for the REST service.
    * (genesis) [#7089](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7089) The `export` command now adds a `initial_height` field in the exported JSON. Baseapp's `CommitMultiStore` now also has a `SetInitialVersion` setter, so it can set the initial store version inside `InitChain` and start a new chain from a given height.
* **General**
    * (crypto/multisig) [#6241](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6241) Add Multisig type directly to the repo. Previously this was in tendermint.

### Improvements

* **Baseapp / Client / REST**
    * (baseapp) [#6186](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6186) Support emitting events during `AnteHandler` execution.
    * (baseapp) [#6053](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6053) Customizable panic recovery handling added for `app.runTx()` method (as proposed in the [ADR 22](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-022-custom-panic-handling.md)).

    * (client) [#5810](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5810) Added a new `--offline` flag that allows commands to be executed without an
    internet connection. Previously, `--generate-only` served this purpose in addition to only allowing txs to be generated. Now, `--generate-only` solely
    allows txs to be generated without being broadcasted and disallows Keybase use and `--offline` allows the use of Keybase but does not allow any
    functionality that requires an online connection.

    pagination.
    * (x/staking) [#8178](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8178) Update default historical header number for stargate
* **General**
    * (crypto) [#7987](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7987) Fix the inconsistency of CryptoCdc, only use
    `codec/legacy.Cdc`.
    * (logging) [#8072](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8072) Refactor logging:
    _ Use [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) over Tendermint's go-kit logging wrapper.
    _ Introduce Tendermint's `--log_format=plain|json` flag. Using format `json` allows for emitting structured JSON
    logs which can be consumed by an external logging facility (e.g. Loggly). Both formats log to STDERR. \* The existing `--log_level` flag and it's default value now solely relates to the global logging
    level (e.g. `info`, `debug`, etc...) instead of `<module>:<level>`.
