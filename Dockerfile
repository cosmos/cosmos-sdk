# This docker image is designed to be used in CI for benchmarks and also by developers wanting an environment that always has the lastest rocksdb and cleveldb. 
# Since the SDK is not simapp, this Dockerfile doesn't build simapp, but instead provides a full development environment for the Cosmos SDK.
# Other Docker images, like simapp, or the various protobuf build iamges could be based on this one
# This Docker image is rolling release, like most developer laptops.  Things will break if upstream changes and we've not kept up do date.  That's intentional.
# This docker image is made here, every 24 hours: https://github.com/notional-labs/archlinux-docker
# Compared to Alpine, this image may be larger, but for example, we do not need to shim glibc onto musl
