<!--------------------------------- BUG FIXES -------------------------------->

## BUG FIXES

### Gaia REST API

### Gaia CLI

* [\#3731](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3731) `keys add --interactive` bip32 passphrase regression fix

### Gaia

### SDK

* \#3728 Truncate decimal multiplication & division in distribution to ensure
         no more than the collected fees / inflation are distributed
* \#3727 Return on zero-length (including []byte{}) PrefixEndBytes() calls
* \#3559 fix occasional failing due to non-determinism in lcd test TestBonding
  where validator is unexpectedly slashed throwing off test calculations
* [\#3411] Include the `RequestInitChain.Time` in the block header init during
`InitChain`.
* [\#3717] Update the vesting specification and implementation to cap deduction from
`DelegatedVesting` by at most `DelegatedVesting`. This accounts for the case where
the undelegation amount may exceed the original delegation amount due to
truncation of undelegation tokens.
* [\#3717] Ignore unknown proposers in allocating rewards for proposers, in case
  unbonding period was just 1 block and proposer was already deleted.
* [\#3726] Cap(clip) reward to remaining coins in AllocateTokens.
