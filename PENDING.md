BUG FIXES

* Gaia REST API

* Gaia CLI  (`gaiacli`)
  - [\#3417](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3417) Fix `q slashing signing-info` panic by ensuring safety of user input and properly returning not found error
  - [\#3345](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3345) Upgrade ledger-cosmos-go dependency to v0.9.3 to pull
    https://github.com/ZondaX/ledger-cosmos-go/commit/ed9aa39ce8df31bad1448c72d3d226bf2cb1a8d1 in order to fix a derivation path issue that causes `gaiacli keys add --recover`
    to malfunction.
  - [\#3419](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3419) Fix `q distr slashes` panic 
  - [\#3453](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3453) The `rest-server` command didn't respect persistent flags such as `--chain-id` and `--trust-node` if they were
