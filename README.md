!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDERGOING RAPID DEVELOPMENT AND NONE OF ITS INTERFACES IS CONSIDERED STABLE.*

*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Note: Requires Go 1.8+**

The Cosmos SDK is the middleware platform that the [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network) is constructed from. The Hub is a blockchain (or, internet of blockchains) in which the Atom supply resides. The Atoms supply is defined at genesis and can change based on the rules of the Hub.

Under the hood, the Cosmos SDK is an [ABCI application](https://github.com/tendermint/abci) designed to be used with the [Tendermint consensus engine](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) to form a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency. It also provides a general purpose framework
for extending the feature-set of the cryptocurrency by implementing plugins.

This SDK affords you all the tools you need to rapidly develop
robust blockchains and blockchain applications which are interoperable with The
Cosmos Hub. It is a blockchain development 'starter-pack' of common blockchain
modules while not enforcing their use thus giving maximum flexibility for
application customization. For example, does your app require fees, how do you
want to log messages, do you enable IBC, do you even have a cryptocurrency? In
this way, the Cosmos SDK is the **Rails of cryptocurrencies**.

Within this repository, the `basecoin` app serves as a reference implementation for how we build ABCI applications in Go, and is the framework in which we implement the [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network). **It's easy to use, and doesn't require any forking** - just implement your plugin, import the libraries, and away you go with a full-stack blockchain and command line tool for transacting.

## Prerequisites

* [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Installation and Documentation

```
go get -u github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cmd/basecoin
```

See the [Cosmos SDK Documentation](http://cosmos-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for complete installation details and usage documentation. To deploy a testnet, see our [repository of deployment tools](https://github.com/tendermint/tools).

# Inspiration

The basic concept for this SDK comes from years of web development. A number of
patterns have arisen in that realm of software which enable people to build remote
servers with APIs remarkably quickly and with high stability. The
[ABCI](https://github.com/tendermint/abci) application interface is similar to
a web API (`DeliverTx` is like POST and `Query` is like GET while `SetOption` is like
the admin playing with the config file). Here are some patterns that might be
useful:

* MVC - separate data model (storage) from business logic (controllers)
* Routers - easily direct each request to the appropriate controller
* Middleware - a series of wrappers that provide global functionality (like
  authentication) to all controllers
* Modules (gems, package, etc) - developers can write a self-contained package
  with a given set of functionality, which can be imported and reused in other
  apps

Also at play is the concept of different tables/schemas in databases, thus you can
keep the different modules safely separated and avoid any accidental (or malicious)
overwriting of data.

Not all of these can be compare one-to-one in the blockchain world, but they do
provide inspiration for building orthogonal pieces that can easily be combined
into various applications.
