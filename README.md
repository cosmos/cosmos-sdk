The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.
It is being used to build `Gaia`, the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.11.5+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Cosmos Hub Mainnet

To run a full-node for the mainnet of the Cosmos Hub, first [install `gaia`](./docs/gaia/installation.md), then follow [the guide](./docs/gaia/join-mainnet.md).

For status updates and genesis file, see the
[launch repo](https://github.com/cosmos/launch).


## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/README.md).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of the SDK, please follow the [SDK Application Tutorial](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial). You can also fork the tutorial's repo to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more, please go to the [Cosmos SDK Docs](./docs/README.md)

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos-SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.
