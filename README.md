The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications. [Tendermint Core (BFT Consensus)](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and the Cosmos SDK are written in the Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), the implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The Cosmos SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.19+](https://go.dev/dl)

## Quick Start

To learn how the Cosmos SDK works from a high-level perspective, see the Cosmos SDK [High-Level Intro](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/intro/overview.html).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of Cosmos SDK, visit [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network). You can also fork the tutorial's repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more information, see the [Cosmos SDK Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute and participate in our [dev calls](./CONTRIBUTING.md#teams-dev-calls).

## Tools and Frameworks

The Cosmos ecosystem is vast.
[Awesome Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/awesome-cosmos) is a community-curated list of notable frameworks, modules and tools.

### Cosmos Hub Mainnet

The Cosmos Hub application, `gaia`, has its own [cosmos/gaia repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia). Go there to join the Cosmos Hub mainnet and more.

### Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC module for the Cosmos SDK has its own [cosmos/ibc-go repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Go there to build and integrate with the IBC module.

### Ignite CLI

Ignite CLI is the all-in-one platform to build, launch, and maintain any crypto application on a sovereign and secured blockchain. If you are building a new app or a new module, use [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/ignite/cli) to get started and speed up development.

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.
