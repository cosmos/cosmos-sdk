The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications. [CometBFT (BFT Consensus)](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) and the Cosmos SDK are written in the Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), the implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The Cosmos SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some breaking changes.

**Note**: Always use the latest maintained [Go](https://go.dev/dl) version for building Cosmos SDK applications.

## Quick Start

To learn how the Cosmos SDK works from a high-level perspective, see the Cosmos SDK [High-Level Intro](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/intro/overview).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of Cosmos SDK, visit [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network). You can also fork the tutorial's repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more information, see the [Cosmos SDK Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute and participate in our [dev calls](./CONTRIBUTING.md#teams-dev-calls).

## Tools and Frameworks

The Cosmos ecosystem is vast.
[Awesome Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/awesome-cosmos) is a community-curated list of notable frameworks, modules and tools.

### Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC module for the Cosmos SDK has its own [cosmos/ibc-go repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Go there to build and integrate with the IBC module.

### Version Matrix

The version matrix below shows which versions of the Cosmos SDK, modules and libraries are compatible with each other.

#### Core Dependencies

Core dependencies are the core libraries that an application may depend on.
Core dependencies not mentioned here as compatible across all maintained SDK versions.

| Cosmos SDK | cosmossdk.io/core | cosmossdk.io/api | cosmossdk.io/x/tx |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 0.52.z     | 1.y.z             | 0.8.z            | 1.y.z             |
| 0.50.z     | 0.11.z            | 0.7.z            | 0.13.z            |
| 0.47.z     | 0.5.z             | 0.3.z            | N/A               |

#### Module Dependencies

Module Dependencies are the modules that an application may depend on and which version of the Cosmos SDK they are compatible with.

> Note: The version table only goes back to 0.50.x, as modules started to become modular with 0.50.z.
> X signals that the module was not spun out into its own go.mod file.
> N/A signals that the module was not available in the Cosmos SDK at that time.

| Cosmos SDK                  | 0.50.z | 0.52.z |
