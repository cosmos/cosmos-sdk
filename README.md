# Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building public, application specific blockchains that can connect to one another using a protocol called [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc) in Go with [Tendermint consensus](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint).

The Cosmos SDK has been used to secure billions of dollars in value and create many well-known public blockchains.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making breaking changes and the software is evolving quickly. 

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.16+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/overview.md).

If you are starting a new app or a new module you can use [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) to help you get started and speed up development. If you have any questions or find a bug, feel free to open an issue in the repo.

For more, please go to the [Cosmos SDK Docs](./docs/).

## Cosmos Hub Mainnet

The Cosmos Hub, `gaia`, has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia). Go there to join the Cosmos Hub mainnet and more.

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos-SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.
