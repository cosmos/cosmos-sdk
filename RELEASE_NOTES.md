# Cosmos SDK v0.50.10 Release Notes

üí¨ [**Release Discussion**](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/discussions/58)

## üöÄ Highlights

For this month patch release of the v0.50.x line, some bugs were fixed.

Notably, we fixed the following:

* Add the root command `module-hash-by-height` to query and retrieve module hashes at a specific height
* `PreBlock` events (mainly `x/upgrade`) are now emitted (this time, for real)
* A fix in runtime baseapp option ordering, giving issue when other modules were having options
