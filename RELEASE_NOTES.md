## ðŸš€ Highlights

Missed the v0.47.0 announcement? Read it [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0).
For this third patch release of the `v0.47.x` line, some of the notable changes include:

* The [barberry](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-security-advisory-barberry/10825) security vulnerability is resolved. All chains using Cosmos SDK `<= v0.47.2` are advised to upgrade to `v0.47.3` **immediately**. A chain is safe as soon as **33%+1** of the voting power has upgraded. Coordinate with your validators to upgrade as soon as possible.
* A command to be able to bootstrap comet from a local snapshot with [`<app> comet bootstrap-state`](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/run-node/run-node#local-state-sync).
* Commands to manage snapshots: Add `snapshot.Cmd(appCreator)` to your chain root command for using them.
* The default logger is now `cosmossdk.io/log`, which supports coloring ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸªðŸŸ¦ and filtering again.
* A bug fix in `x/group` migration. Chains migrating from v0.46.x to v0.47.x must use at least v0.47.**3**.
