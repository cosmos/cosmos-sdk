## Maintenance Policy

Cosmos SDK Olympus (v0.52) final release is approaching really soon. That means the Eden line (v0.50.x) will soon only be supported for bug fixes only, as per our release policy. Earlier versions are not maintained.  

Note, that the next SDK release, v0.52, does not include `x/params` migration, when migrating from < v0.47, v0.50.x **or** v0.47.x, is a mandatory migration.

Start integrating with [Cosmos SDK Eden (v0.52)](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#v052x) and enjoy and the new features and performance improvements.
