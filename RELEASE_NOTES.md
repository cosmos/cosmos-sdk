## üöÄ Highlights

This is the first patch release for the `v0.47.x` line. Missed the v0.47.0 announcement? Read it [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0).

It includes sweet things we could not include in `v0.47.0` due to the feature freeze.

Notably, it introduces a new `x/group` query for listing of all groups on a chain and a `x/gov` helper function for commands to use when the command is for submitting a governance proposal.
