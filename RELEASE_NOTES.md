## Upgrading from v0.50.0-rc.0

If you have started integrating with v0.50.0-rc.0, this release candidate contains one breaking change.
This is contrary to our usual policy of not introducing breaking changes in release candidates, but we believe this change is necessary to ensure a smooth upgrade from previous SDK version to v0.50.0. Additionally, it gives a better UX for users integrating vote extensions. Read more about the change [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-068-preblock.md).

Update your app.go / app_config.go as instructed in the [UPGRADING.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.50.x/UPGRADING.md#set-preblocker).

Additionally, if you were using `baseapp.SetPreFinalizeBlockHook` in v0.50.0-rc.0, you should now use `baseapp.SetPreBlocker` for having the same functionality.
