# Cosmos SDK v0.52.0-rc.2 Release Notes

This second release canditate include bug fixes found during integration.
Additionally, it bumps the SDK dependencies to their final release:

* cosmossdk.io/core v1.0.0
* cosmossdk.io/collection  v1.0.0
* cosmossdk.io/schema v1.0.0
* cosmossdk.io/x/tx v1.0.0

Modules remained stable and nothing has changed since their first release candidate.
We encourage chains to already start integrating with this release candidate as APIs are stable.

Cosmos SDK Olympus is the first totally modular (as in package) release of the Cosmos SDK. Many components have been extracted in their own modules. Refer to the [version matrix](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#version-matrix) to understand what it means.

A final release is expected in the coming **days**.
