# Cosmos SDK v0.41.3 "Stargate" Release Notes

This release fixes a build failure caused by a small API breakage introduced in Tendermint v0.34.7. It is **highly recommended** that all applications using v0.41.2 upgrade to v0.41.3 as soon as possible.

See the [Cosmos SDK v0.41.3 milestone](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/milestone/39?closed=1) on our issue tracker for details.
