# Cosmos SDK v0.47.5 Release Notes

ðŸ’¬ [**Release Discussion**](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/discussions/categories/announcements)

## ðŸš€ Highlights

Get ready for v0.50.0 and start integrating with the next [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.0-rc.0) release.

For this 5th patch release of the `v0.47.x` line, some of the notable changes include:

* A new command for importing private keys encoded in hex. This complements the existing `import` command that supports mnemonic and key files.
  Use `<appd> keys import <name> <hex>` to import a private key encoded in hex.
* A new command, `rpc.QueryEventForTxCmd` for querying a transaction by its hash and blocking until the transaction is included in a block. It is useful as an alternative to the legacy `--sync block`.
