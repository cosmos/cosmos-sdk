# Cosmos SDK v0.50.7 Release Notes

üí¨ [**Release Discussion**](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/discussions/58)

## üöÄ Highlights

For this month patch release of the v0.50.x line, a few improvements were added to the SDK and some bugs were fixed.

Notably, we added and fixed the following:

* Add extra checks in x/consensus `MsgUpdateParams` to prevent footguns when updating the consensus parameters.
    * Forgetting a field in a x/consensus parameter change gov proposal could lead to a chain halt.
    * The fix is in theory consensus breaking, but in practice, it is only a footgun prevention (the path only triggers if the proposal was executed and was invalid). Please ensure that all validators are on v0.50.7 before the execution of a `x/consensus` params update proposal.
* Remove txs from the mempool when they fail in RecheckTX
