## End-of-Life Notice

`v0.47.15` is the last release of the `v0.47.x` line. Per this version, the v0.47.x line reached its end-of-life.
The SDK team maintains the [latest two major versions of the SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/RELEASE_PROCESS.md#major-release-maintenance). This means no features, improvements or bug fixes will be backported to the `v0.47.x` line. Per our policy, the `v0.47.x` line will receive security patches only.

We encourage all chains to upgrade to Cosmos SDK Olympus (`rc`) (`v0.52.0`), or the `v0.50.x` line.
