## End-of-Life Notice

`v0.45.15` is the last release of the `v0.45.x` line. Per this version, the v0.45.x line reached its end-of-life.
The SDK team maintains the two latest major versions of the SDK. This means no features, improvements or bug fixes will be backported to the `v0.45.x` line. Per our policy, the `v0.45.x` line will receive security patches only.

We encourage all chains to upgrade to the latest release of the SDK, or the `v0.46.x` line.

Refer to the [upgrading guide](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/UPGRADING.md) for how to upgrade a chain to the latest release.
