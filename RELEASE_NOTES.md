ðŸ’¬ [**Release Discussion**](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/discussions/6)

## ðŸš€ Highlights

For this last patch release of the v0.47.x line, only the dependency on `cosmossdk.io/math` has been bumped.
This release is mainly here to disclose the end-of-life of the `v0.47.x` line.

Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.15/CHANGELOG.md) for an exhaustive list of changes or [compare changes](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.47.14...v0.47.15) from last release.

## End-of-Life Notice

`v0.47.15` is the last release of the `v0.47.x` line. Per this version, the v0.47.x line reached its end-of-life.
The SDK team maintains the [latest two major versions of the SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/RELEASE_PROCESS.md#major-release-maintenance). This means no features, improvements or bug fixes will be backported to the `v0.47.x` line. Per our policy, the `v0.47.x` line will receive security patches only.

We encourage all chains to upgrade to Cosmos SDK Olympus (`rc`) (`v0.52.0`), or the `v0.50.x` line.
