# Cosmos SDK v0.40.0 "Stargate" Release Notes

This release introduces several new important updates to the Cosmos SDK. The release notes below provide an overview of the larger high-level changes introduced in the v0.40 (aka Stargate) release series.

That being said, this release does contain many more minor and module-level changes besides those mentioned below. For a comprehsive list of all breaking changes and improvements since the v0.39 release series, please see the [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.40.x/CHANGELOG.md).

## Protocol Buffer Migration

Stargate introduces [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) as the new standard serialization format for blockchain state & wire communication within the Cosmos SDK. Protobuf definitions are organized into packages that mirror Cosmos SDK modules in the new [./proto](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/proto) directory of the SDK repo.

For an overview of the SDK's usage of protocol buffers, please look at the following ADRs and meta-issues which tracked the corresponding work:
- [ADR019 Protobuf State Encoding](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-019-protobuf-state-encoding.md) / [Full Proto Encoding (#5444)](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5444)
- [ADR020 Protobuf Transaction Encoding](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-020-protobuf-transaction-encoding.md) / [Proto Any Tx Migration (#6213)](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6213) 
- [ADR021 Protobuf Query Encoding](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-021-protobuf-query-encoding.md) / [Query Protobuf Migration (#5921)](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5921)
- [ADR023 Protobuf Naming Conventions](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-023-protobuf-naming.md)
- [ADR027 Deterministic Protobuf Serialization](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-027-deterministic-protobuf-serialization.md)

As a high level summary these represent the following major changes to the SDK:
- New protocol buffer based encoding for all blockchain state (direct queries to tendermint now return protobuf binary encoded data, as opposed to Amino encoded data)
- New transaction signing path implemented according to ADR020 above
- Two new querier APIs (see [#5921](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5921) for details)
  - Support for new gRPC based querier services
  - gRPC Gateway for REST querying corresponding to the new gRPC querier services

**Note:** Existing Amino REST endpoints are all preserved, though they are planned to be deprecated in a future release.

## Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The `x/ibc` module is now available and ready for use. High level IBC documentation is available at [docs.cosmos.network](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/ibc/overview.html).

## Single application binary [#6571](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6571)

Cosmos SDK now compiles to a single application binary, as opposed to seperate binaries for running a node and one for the CLI & REST server.

We've now included a barebones application `simapp` / `simd` for testing and demonstrating how an SDK application should be constructed.

Details of the CLI refactor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6571).

## Test Network Testing Framework [#6489](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6489)

Introduction of the testutil package. This package allows the creation of an entirely in-process testing cluster with fully operational Tendermint nodes constructed with SimApp. Each node has an RPC & API exposed. In addition, the network exposes a Local client that can be used to directly interface with Tendermint's RPC. The test network is entirely configurable.

## Tendermint 0.34 [#6365](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6365)

Update to the latest version of tendermint which adds support for the following (in addition many other improvements):
- ABCI update to give application control over block pruning
- Support for arbitrary initial block height
- Support for State Sync
- Evidence handling for new types of evidence submitted by Tendermint from light clients

A more detailed list of Tendermint updates can be found [here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0340-rc4).
