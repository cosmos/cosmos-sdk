Announcing Cosmos SDK v0.53

We are pleased to announce the release of Cosmos SDK v0.53! We’re excited to be delivering a new version of the Cosmos SDK that provides key features and updates while minimizing breaking changes so you can focus on what matters most: building.

Upgrading to this version of the Cosmos SDK from any `v0.50.x` release will **require a coordinated chain upgrade**.
