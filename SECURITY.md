### Guidelines

We require that all researchers:

* Abide by this policy to disclose vulnerabilities, and avoid posting
  vulnerability information in public places, including GitHub, Discord,
  Telegram, and Twitter.
* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience,
  disruption to production systems (including but not limited to the Cosmos
  Hub), and destruction of data.
* Keep any information about vulnerabilities that you’ve discovered confidential
  between yourself and the Cosmos engineering team until the issue has been
  resolved and disclosed.
* Avoid posting personally identifiable information, privately or publicly.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research on this
  vulnerability
* Work with you to understand, resolve and ultimately disclose the issue in a
  timely fashion
