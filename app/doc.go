/*
Package app contains data structures that provide basic data storage functionality and act as a
bridge between the ABCI interface and the SDK abstractions.

BaseApp has no state except the CommitMultiStore you provide upon init. You must also provide a
Handler.

Transaction parsing is typically handled by the first Decorator.
