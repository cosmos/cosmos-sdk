## Context

> This section contains all the context one needs to understand the current state, and why there is a problem. It should be as succinct as possible and introduce the high level idea behind the solution. 
## Decision

> This section explains all of the details of the proposed solution, including implementation details.
It should also describe affects / corollary items that may need to be changed as a part of this.
If the proposed change will be large, please also indicate a way to do the change to maximize ease of review.
(e.g. the optimal split of things to do between separate PR's)

## Status

> A decision may be "proposed" if it hasn't been agreed upon yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed upon. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

{Deprecated|Proposed|Accepted}
