I really hope you wrote this down when you created the new key.
The seed is only displayed on creation, never again.

You can also use this to copy a key between multiple testnets,
simply by "recovering" the key in the other nets you want to copy
to.  Of course, it has no coins on the other nets, just the same address.`,
