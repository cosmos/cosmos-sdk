/*
Package std defines all the common and standard Cosmos SDK Protocol Buffer
message definitions and type implementations. The std package defines and exposes
a single concrete Codec type that implements all the necessary module codec
interfaces along with all the types necessary to use those modules.

Applications can choose to either use the codec directly or even extend it without
having the need to redefine all the message and type implementations.
