// Package appmodule defines what is needed for an module to be used in the Cosmos SDK (runtime).
// It is equivalent to the appmodulev2 package, but less flexible to stay compatible with baseapp instead of server/v2.
// If you are looking at integrating dependency injection into your module please see depinject appconfig documentation.
