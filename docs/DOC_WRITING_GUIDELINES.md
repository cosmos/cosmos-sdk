# Documentation Writing Guidelines

## Best Practices

+ Check the spelling and grammar, even if you have to copy and paste from an external source.
+ Use simple sentences. Easy-to-read sentences mean the reader can quickly use the guidance you share.
+ Try to express your thoughts in a concise and clean way.
+ Don't abuse `code` format when writing in plain English.
+ Follow Google developer documentation [style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
+ Check the meaning of words in Microsoft's [A-Z word list and term collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms) (use the search input!).
