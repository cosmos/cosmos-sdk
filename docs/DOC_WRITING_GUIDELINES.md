# Documentation Writing Guidelines

## Best Practices

* Check the spelling and grammar, even if you have to copy and paste from an external source.
* Use simple sentences. Easy-to-read sentences mean the reader can quickly use the guidance you share.
* Try to express your thoughts in a concise and clean way.
* Don't abuse `code` format when writing in plain English.
* Follow Google developer documentation [style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
* Check the meaning of words in Microsoft's [A-Z word list and term collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms) (use the search input!).
* RFC keywords should be used in technical documents (uppercase) and we recommend to use them in user documentation (lowercase). The RFC keywords are: "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL. They are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
