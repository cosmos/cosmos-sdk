Welcome to the SDK docs!

## Learn the SDK

### SDK Intro

If you are a newcomer and would like to learn more about the Cosmos SDK, this **[intro](./intro/README.md)** is a good starting place.

### SDK tutorial

If you like to learn by doing, you can follow the **[SDK application tutorial](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial)**. It showcases how to build an SDK-based blockchain from scratch, and teaches you about the basic principles the SDK in the process.

### Resources

- [Specifications](./spec/README.md): Specifications of modules and other parts of the Cosmos SDK. 
- [SDK API Reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk): Godocs of the Cosmos SDK.
- [REST API spec](https://cosmos.network/rpc/): List of endpoints to interact with a `gaia` full-node through REST.

## Cosmos Hub testnet

To install the latest version of the `gaia` application (application of the Cosmos Hub) and join the public testnet, **click [here](./gaia/join-testnet.md)**

To start your own `gaia` testnet, **click [here](./gaia/deploy-testnet.md)**

## Creating a new SDK project

To create a new project, you can either:

- Fork [this repo](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial/). Do not forget to remove the `nameservice` module from the various files if you don't need it. 
- Use community tools like [chainkit](https://github.com/blocklayerhq/chainkit).

## Languages

The Cosmos-SDK is currently written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), though the
framework could be implemented similarly in other languages.
Contact us for information about funding an implementation in another language.
