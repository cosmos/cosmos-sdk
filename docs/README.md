# Cosmos SDK Documentation

## Get Started

- **[Cosmos SDK Intro](./intro/overview.md)**: High-level overview of the Cosmos SDK.
- **[Starport](https://docs.starport.network/)**: A developer-friendly interface to the Cosmos SDK to scaffold, launch, and maintain any crypto application on a sovereign and secured blockchain.
- **[SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/)**: Tutorials that showcase how to build Cosmos SDK-based blockchains from scratch and explain the basic Cosmos SDK principles in the process.

## Reference Docs

- **[Basics](./basics/)**: Basic concepts of the Cosmos SDK, including the standard anatomy of an application, the transaction lifecycle, and accounts management.
- **[Core](./core/)**: Core concepts of the Cosmos SDK, including `baseapp`, the `store`, or the `server`.
- **[Building Modules](./building-modules/)**: Important concepts for module developers like `message`, `keeper`, and `querier`.
- **[IBC](./ibc/)**: IBC protocol integration and concepts.
- **[Running a Node, API, CLI](./run-node/)**: How to run a node and interact with the node using the CLI and the API.
- **[Migrations](./migrations/)**: Migration guides for updating to newer versions of Cosmos SDK.

## Other Resources

- **[Module Directory](../x/)**: Cosmos SDK module implementations and their respective documentation.
- **[Specifications](./spec/)**: Specifications of modules and other parts of the Cosmos SDK.
- **[Cosmos SDK API Reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk)**: Godocs of the Cosmos SDK.
- **[REST and RPC Endpoints](https://cosmos.network/rpc/)**: List of endpoints to interact with a `gaia` full-node.
- **[Rosetta API](./run-node/rosetta.md)**: Rosetta API integration.

## Cosmos Hub

The Cosmos Hub (`gaia`) docs have moved to [github.com/cosmos/gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/master/docs).

## Languages

The Cosmos SDK is written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), though the framework could be implemented similarly in other languages. Contact us for information about funding an implementation in another language.

## Contribute

See the [DOCS_README.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/DOCS_README.md) for details of the build process and considerations when making changes.
