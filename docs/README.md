# Cosmos SDK Documentation

## Get Started

-  **[SDK Intro](./intro/README.md)**: High-level overview of the Cosmos SDK.
-  **[SDK application tutorial](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial)**: A tutorial to learn the SDK. It showcases how to build an SDK-based blockchain from scratch, and explains the basic principles of the SDK in the process.

## Resources

- [Specifications](./spec/README.md): Specifications of modules and other parts of the Cosmos SDK. 
- [SDK API Reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk): Godocs of the Cosmos SDK.
- [REST API spec](https://cosmos.network/rpc/): List of endpoints to interact with a `gaia` full-node through REST.

## Creating a new SDK project

To create a new project, you can either:

- Fork [this repo](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial/). Do not forget to remove the `nameservice` module from the various files if you don't need it. 
- Use community tools like [chainkit](https://github.com/blocklayerhq/chainkit).

## Cosmos Hub 

The Cosmos Hub (`gaia`) docs have moved [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/master/docs).

## Languages

The Cosmos-SDK is currently written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), though the
framework could be implemented similarly in other languages.
Contact us for information about funding an implementation in another language.
