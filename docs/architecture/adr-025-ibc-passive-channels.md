## Changelog

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The current "naive" IBC Relayer strategy currently establishes a single predetermined IBC channel atop a single connection between two clients (each potentially of a different chain).  This strategy then detects packets to be relayed by watching for `send_packet` and `recv_packet` events matching that channel, and sends the necessary transactions to relay those packets.

We wish to expand this "naive" strategy to a "passive" one which detects and relays both channel handshake messages and packets on a given connection, without the need to know each channel in advance of relaying it.

In order to accomplish this, we propose adding more comprehensive events to expose channel metadata for each transaction sent from the `x/ibc/04-channel/keeper/handshake.go` and `x/ibc/04-channel/keeper/packet.go` modules.

Here is an example of what would be in `ChanOpenInit`:

```go
const (
  EventTypeChannelMeta = "channel_meta"
  AttributeKeyAction = "action"
  AttributeKeyHops = "hops"
  AttributeKeyOrder = "order"
  AttributeKeySrcPort = "src_port"
  AttributeKeySrcChannel = "src_channel"
  AttributeKeySrcVersion = "src_version"
  AttributeKeyDstPort = "dst_port"
  AttributeKeyDstChannel = "dst_channel"
  AttributeKeyDstVersion = "dst_version"
)
// ...
  // Emit Event with Channel metadata for the relayer to pick up and
  // relay to the other chain
  ctx.EventManager().EmitEvents(sdk.Events{
    sdk.NewEvent(
      types.EventTypeChannelMeta,
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyAction, "open_init"),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcConnection, connectionHops[0]),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyHops, strings.Join(connectionHops, ",")),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyOrder, order.String()),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcPort, portID),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcChannel, chanenlID),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcVersion, version),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstPort, counterparty.GetPortID()),
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstChannel, counterparty.GetChannelID()),
      // The destination version is not yet known, but a value is necessary to pad
      // the event attribute offsets
      sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstVersion, ""),
    ),
  })
```

These metadata events capture all the "header" information needed to route IBC channel handshake transactions without requiring the client to query any data except that of the connection ID that it is willing to relay.  It is intended that `channel_meta.src_connection` is the only event key that needs to be indexed for a passive relayer to function.

### Accepting Channel Opens

In the case of the passive relayer, when one chain sends a `ChanOpenInit`, the relayer should inform the other chain of this open attempt and allow that chain to decide how (and if) it continues the handshake.  Once both chains have actively approved the channel opening, then the rest of the handshake can happen as it does with the current "naive" relayer.

To implement this behavior, we propose adding a new callback `cbs.OnChanOpenAccept` which is either returns the version number to be used in the `keeper.ChanOpenTry`, or an error.  If the callback is not supplied, then the default behaviour would be to pass through directly to `channel.HandleMsgChannelOpenTry`, for compatibility with existing chains that expect a "naive" relayer.

Here is how this callback would be used, in the implementation of `x/ibc/handler.go`:

```go
// Declare an interface for accepting a channel open.
type ChanOpenAcceptor interface {
  OnChanOpenAccept(
    ctx sdk.Context,
    order channeltypes.Order,
    connectionHops []string,
    portID,
    channelID,
    counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty,
    proposedVersion,
    counterpartyVersion string,
  ) (string, error)
}
// ...
    case channel.MsgChannelOpenTry:
      // Lookup module by port capability
      module, portCap, err := k.PortKeeper.LookupModuleByPort(ctx, msg.PortID)
      if err != nil {
              return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(err, "could not retrieve module from port-id")
      }
      // =======================================
      // NEW CODE: Check if the module defines an OnChanOpenAccept callback.
      // Retrieve callbacks from router
      cbs, ok := k.Router.GetRoute(module)
      if !ok {
              return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(port.ErrInvalidRoute, "route not found to module: %s", module)
      }
      // Default behaviour: use the proposed version directly.
      version := proposedVersion
      if acceptor, ok := cbs.(ChanOpenAcceptor); ok {
        // Allow the acceptor to alter the proposed version or reject the connection
        version, err = acceptor(ctx, msg.Channel.Ordering, msg.Channel.ConnectionHops, msg.PortID, msg.ChannelID, cap, msg.Channel.Counterparty, msg.Channel.Version, msg.CounterpartyVersion)
        if err != nil {
          return nil, err
        }
      }
      // END OF NEW CODE
      // ======================================
      // Continue the handshake.
      res, cap, err := channel.HandleMsgChannelOpenTry(ctx, k.ChannelKeeper, portCap, msg)
      // ...
```

## Decision

- Expose events to allow "passive" connection relayers.
- Enable application-initiated channels via such passive relayers.
- Allow port modules to control which channel open attempts they honour.

## Consequences

### Positive

Makes channels into a completeÂ application-level abstraction.

Applications have full control over initiating and accepting channels, rather than expecting a relayer to tell them when to do so.

A passive relayer does not have to know what kind of channel (version string, ordering constraints, firewalling logic) the application supports.  These are negotiated directly between applications.

### Negative

Introduces different SDK paths for "naive" versus "passive" relayers.  It would be cleaner to have only one code path that accomodated both designs.

It may be better to break compatibility and always require the `OnChanOpenAccept` callback to be defined.

### Neutral

More IBC events are exposed.
