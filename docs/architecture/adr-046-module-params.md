# ADR 046: Module Params

## Changelog

- Sep 22, 2021: Initial Draft

## Status

Proposed

## Abstract

This ADR describes an alternative approach to how Cosmos SDK modules use, interact,
and store their respective parameters.

## Context

Currently, in the Cosmos SDK, modules that require the use of parameters use the
`x/params` module. The `x/params` works by having modules define parameters,
typically via a simple `Params` structure, and registering that structure in
the `x/params` module via a unique `Subspace` that belongs to the respective
registering module. The registering module then has unique access to its respective
`Subspace`. Through this `Subspace`, the module can get and set its `Params`
structure.

In addition, the Cosmos SDK's `x/gov` module has direct support for changing
parameters on-chain via a `ParamChangeProposal` governance proposal type, where
stakeholders can vote on suggested parameter changes.

There are various tradeoffs to using the `x/params` module to manage individual
module parameters. Namely, managing parameters essentially comes for "free" in
that developers only need to define the `Params` struct, the `Subspace`, and the
various auxiliary functions, e.g. `ParamSetPairs`, on the `Params` type. However,
there are some notable drawbacks. These drawbacks include the fact that parameters
are serialized in state via JSON which is extremely slow. In addition, parameter
changes via `ParamChangeProposal` governance proposals have no way of reading from
or writing to state. In other words, it is currently not possible to have any
state transitions in the application during an attempt to change param(s).

## Decision

We will build off of the alignment of `x/gov` and `x/authz` work per
[#9810](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9810). Namely, module developers
will create one or more unique parameter data structures that must be serialized
to state. The Param data structures must implement `sdk.Msg` interface with respective
Protobuf Msg service method which will validate and update the parameters with all
necessary changes. The `x/gov` module via the work done in
[#9810](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9810), will dispatch Param
messages, which will be handled by Protobuf Msg services.

Note, it is up to developers to decide how to structure their parameters and
the respective `sdk.Msg` messages. Consider the parameters currently defined in
`x/auth` using the `x/params` module for parameter management:

```protobuf
message Params {
  uint64 max_memo_characters       = 1;
  uint64 tx_sig_limit              = 2;
  uint64 tx_size_cost_per_byte     = 3;
  uint64 sig_verify_cost_ed25519   = 4;
  uint64 sig_verify_cost_secp256k1 = 5;
}
```

Developers can choose to either create a unique data structure for every field in
`Params` or they can create a single `Params` structure as outlined above in the
case of `x/auth`.

In the former, `x/params`, approach, a `sdk.Msg` would need to be created for every single
field along with a handler. This can become burdensome if there are a lot of
parameter fields. In the latter case, there is only a single data structure and
thus only a single message handler, however, the message handler might have to be
more sophisticated in that it might need to understand what parameters are being
changed vs what parameters are untouched.

Params change proposals are made using the `x/gov` module. Execution is done through
`x/authz` authorization to the root `x/gov` module's account.

Continuing to use `x/auth`, we demonstrate a more complete example:

```go
type Params struct {
	MaxMemoCharacters      uint64
	TxSigLimit             uint64
	TxSizeCostPerByte      uint64
	SigVerifyCostED25519   uint64
	SigVerifyCostSecp256k1 uint64
}

type MsgUpdateParams struct {
	MaxMemoCharacters      uint64
	TxSigLimit             uint64
	TxSizeCostPerByte      uint64
	SigVerifyCostED25519   uint64
	SigVerifyCostSecp256k1 uint64
}

type MsgUpdateParamsResponse struct {}

func (ms msgServer) UpdateParams(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgUpdateParams) (*types.MsgUpdateParamsResponse, error) {
  ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

  // verification logic...

  // persist params
  params := ParamsFromMsg(msg)
  ms.SaveParams(ctx, params)

  return &types.MsgUpdateParamsResponse{}, nil
}

func ParamsFromMsg(msg *types.MsgUpdateParams) Params {
  // ...
}
```

A gRPC `Service` query should also be provided, for example:

```protobuf
service Query {
  // ...
  
  rpc Params(QueryParamsRequest) returns (QueryParamsResponse) {
    option (google.api.http).get = "/cosmos/<module>/v1beta1/params";
  }
}

message QueryParamsResponse {
  Params params = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

## Consequences

As a result of implementing the module parameter methodology, we gain the ability
for module parameter changes to be stateful and extensible to fit nearly every
application's use case. We will be able to emit events (and trigger hooks registered
to that events using the work proposed in [even hooks](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/discussions/9656)),
call other Msg service methods or perform migration.
In addition, there will be significant gains in performance when it comes to reading
and writing parameters from and to state, especially if a specific set of parameters
are read on a consistent basis.

However, this methodology will require developers to implement more types and
Msg service metohds which can become burdensome if many parameters exist. In addition,
developers are required to implement persistance logics of module parameters.
However, this should be trivial.

### Backwards Compatibility

The new method for working with module parameters is naturally not backwards
compatible with the existing `x/params` module. However, the `x/params` will
remain in the Cosmos SDK and will be marked as deprecated with no additional
functionality being added apart from potential bug fixes. Note, the `x/params`
module may be removed entirely in a future release.

### Positive

- Module parameters are serialized more efficiently
- Modules are able to react on parameters changes and perform additional actions.
- Special events can be emitted, allowing hooks to be triggered.

### Negative

- Module parameters becomes slightly more burdensome for module developers:
    - Modules are now responsible for persisting and retrieving parameter state
    - Modules are now required to have unique message handlers to handle parameter
      changes per unique parameter data structure.

### Neutral

- Requires [#9810](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9810) to be reviewed
  and merged.
