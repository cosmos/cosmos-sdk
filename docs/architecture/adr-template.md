# ADR {ADR-NUMBER}: {TITLE}

## Changelog

* {date}: {changelog}

## Status

{DRAFT | PROPOSED} Not Implemented

> Please have a look at the [PROCESS](./PROCESS.md#adr-status) page.
> Use DRAFT if the ADR is in a draft stage (draft PR) or PROPOSED if it's in review.

## Abstract

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide
> a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ADR.
> A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

## Context

> This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political,
> social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be
> called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply
> describing facts. It should clearly explain the problem and motivation that the
> proposal aims to resolve.
> {context body}

## Alternatives

> This section describes alternative designs to the chosen design. This section
> is important and if an adr does not have any alternatives then it should be
> considered that the ADR was not thought through. 

## Decision

> This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full
> sentences, with active voice. "We will ..."
> {decision body}

## Consequences

> This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All
> consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular
> decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them
> affect the team and project in the future.

### Backwards Compatibility

> All ADRs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section
> describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The ADR must explain
> how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. ADR submissions
> without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

### Positive

> {positive consequences}

### Negative

> {negative consequences}

### Neutral

> {neutral consequences}

## Further Discussions

> While an ADR is in the DRAFT or PROPOSED stage, this section should contain a
> summary of issues to be solved in future iterations (usually referencing comments
> from a pull-request discussion).
> 
> Later, this section can optionally list ideas or improvements the author or
> reviewers found during the analysis of this ADR.

## Test Cases [optional]

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for ADRs that are affecting consensus
changes. Other ADRs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
