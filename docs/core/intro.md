# Introduction

Welcome to the Cosmos-SDK Core Documentation. 

Here you will learn how to use the Cosmos-SDK to build Basecoin, a

We proceed through a series of increasingly advanced and complete implementations of 
the Basecoin application, with each implementation showcasing a new component of
the SDK:
