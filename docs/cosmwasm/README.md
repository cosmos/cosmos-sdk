# CosmWasm smart contracts

>CosmWasm is a smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. Simply put, it's the Cosmos (Cosm) way of using WebAssembly (Wasm) hence the name.

>CosmWasm is written as a module that can plug into the Cosmos SDK. This means that anyone currently building a blockchain using the Cosmos SDK can quickly and easily add CosmWasm smart contracting support to their chain, without adjusting existing logic.

Read more about writing smart contracts with CosmWasm at their [documentation site](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/1.0/), or visit [the repository](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm).
