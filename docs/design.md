## Design Goals

### Store

- Fast balanced dynamic Merkle tree for storing application state
- Support multiple Merkle tree backends in a single store 
    - allows using Ethereum Patricia Trie and Tendermint IAVL in same app
- Support iteration
- Provide caching for intermediate state during execution of blocks and transactions (including for iteration)
- Retain some amount of recent historical state
- Allow many kinds of proofs (exists, absent, range, etc.) on current and retained historical state

### ABCI Application

- Simple connector between developer's application logic and the ABCI protocol
- Simplify discrepancy between DeliverTx and CheckTx
- Handles ABCI handshake logic and historical state
- Provide simple hooks to BeginBlock and EndBlock 

### Transaction Processing

- Transactions consist of composeable messages 
- Processing via series of handlers that handle authenticate, deduct fees, transfer coins, etc.
- Developers control tx encoding
    - Default go-wire
    - Must be able to write eg. Ethermint using the SDK with Ethereum-native transaction encoding
- Handler access to the store is restricted via capabilities and interfaces
- Context object holds

### Data Types

- Default Ethereum-style Account 
- Default multi-asset Coins
