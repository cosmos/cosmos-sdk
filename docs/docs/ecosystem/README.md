# Ecosystem 

This section highlights some of the cosmos ecosystem tooling and where to find it. 

## IBC

See the official [`ibc-go` documentation](https://ibc.cosmos.network).

### `x/capability`

The capability module was once a Cosmos SDK module. From SDK v0.48, this module is maintained by the IBC team.
Find out more on their [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/fdd664698d79864f1e00e147f9879e58497b5ef1/modules/capability).

## CosmWasm smart contracts

>CosmWasm is a smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. Simply put, it's the Cosmos (Cosm) way of using WebAssembly (Wasm) hence the name.

>CosmWasm is written as a module that can plug into the Cosmos SDK. This means that anyone currently building a blockchain using the Cosmos SDK can quickly and easily add CosmWasm smart contracting support to their chain, without adjusting existing logic.

Read more about writing smart contracts with CosmWasm at their [documentation site](https://book.cosmwasm.com/), or visit [the repository](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm).

## EVM

Read more about writing smart contracts with solidity at the official [`evm` documentation page](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/evm/).
