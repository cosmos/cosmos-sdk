# What is Cosmos?

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by classical BFT consensus algorithms like [Tendermint]().

The first blockchain in the Cosmos Network is the [Cosmos Hub](), whose native token is the Atom. Cosmos is a permission-less network, meaning that anybody can build a blockchain on it.

Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.
