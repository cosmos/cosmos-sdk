# Lotion JS Overview

Lotion is a new way to create blockchain apps in JavaScript, which aims to make writing new blockchains fast and fun. It builds on top of Tendermint using the ABCI protocol. Lotion lets you write secure, scalable applications that can easily interoperate with other blockchains on the Cosmos Network using IBC.

Lotion itself is a tiny framework; its true power comes from the network of small, focused modules built upon it. Adding a fully-featured cryptocurrency to your blockchain, for example, takes only a few lines of code.
