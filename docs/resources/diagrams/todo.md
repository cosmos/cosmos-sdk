The following diagrams should be created to aid in comprehension of the SDK:
  - Genesis circuit 
  - App structure (aka use of baseapp in something like gaia) 
  - Simulation framework 
  - Slashing Mechanism
  - Staking Mechanism 
  - Staking/Slashing Mechanism specific to use of hooks
  - Governance Mechanism
  - Distribution Mechanism
  - Inflation Mechanism (easier)
  - IBC Mechanism

These diagrams should reference specific structs/interfaces from the codebase,
logic flow and interconnectivity with other mechanisms etc. It's recommended that
https://www.draw.io/ be used, hence the raw diagram xml can be saved directly to 
the Cosmos-SDK repo and adapted with the codebase.
