# RFC {RFC-NUMBER}: {TITLE}

## Changelog

* {date}: {changelog}

## Background

> The next section is the "Background" section. This section should be at least two paragraphs and can take up to a whole 
> page in some cases. The guiding goal of the background section is: as a newcomer to this project (new employee, team 
> transfer), can I read the background section and follow any links to get the full context of why this change is  
> necessary? 
> 
> If you can't show a random engineer the background section and have them acquire nearly full context on the necessity 
> for the RFC, then the background section is not full enough. To help achieve this, link to prior RFCs, discussions, and 
> more here as necessary to provide context so you don't have to simply repeat yourself.


## Proposal

> The next required section is "Proposal" or "Goal". Given the background above, this section proposes a solution. 
> This should be an overview of the "how" for the solution, but for details further sections will be used.


## Abandoned Ideas (Optional)

> As RFCs evolve, it is common that there are ideas that are abandoned. Rather than simply deleting them from the 
> document, you should try to organize them into sections that make it clear they're abandoned while explaining why they 
> were abandoned.
> 
> When sharing your RFC with others or having someone look back on your RFC in the future, it is common to walk the same 
> path and fall into the same pitfalls that we've since matured from. Abandoned ideas are a way to recognize that path 
> and explain the pitfalls and why they were abandoned.

## Descision

> This section describes alternative designs to the chosen design. This section
> is important and if an adr does not have any alternatives then it should be
> considered that the ADR was not thought through. 

## Consequences (optional)

> This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All
> consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular
> decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them
> affect the team and project in the future.

### Backwards Compatibility

> All ADRs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section
> describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The ADR must explain
> how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. ADR submissions
> without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

### Positive

> {positive consequences}

### Negative

> {negative consequences}

### Neutral

> {neutral consequences}



### References

> Links to external materials needed to follow the discussion may be added here.
>
> In addition, if the discussion in a request for comments leads to any design
> decisions, it may be helpful to add links to the ADR documents here after the
> discussion has settled.

## Discussion

> This section contains the core of the discussion.
>
> There is no fixed format for this section, but ideally changes to this
> section should be updated before merging to reflect any discussion that took
> place on the PR that made those changes.
