# Rosetta

The `rosetta` package implements Coinbase's [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org). This document provides instructions on how to use the Rosetta API integration. For information about the motivation and design choices, refer to [ADR 035](../architecture/adr-035-rosetta-api-support.md).

## Add Rosetta Command

The Rosetta API server is a stand-alone server that connects to a node of a chain developed with Cosmos SDK.

To enable Rosetta API support, it's required to add the `RosettaCommand` to your application's root command file (e.g. `appd/cmd/root.go`).

Import the `server` package:

```go
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server"
```

Find the following line:

```go
initRootCmd(rootCmd, encodingConfig)
```

After that line, add the following:

```go
rootCmd.AddCommand(
  server.RosettaCommand(encodingConfig.InterfaceRegistry, encodingConfig.Marshaler)
)
```

The `RosettaCommand` function builds the `rosetta` root command and is defined in the `server` package within Cosmos SDK.

Since weâ€™ve updated the Cosmos SDK to work with the Rosetta API, updating the application's root command file is all you need to do.

An implementation example can be found in `simapp` package.

## Use Rosetta Command

To run Rosetta in your application CLI, use the following command:

```
appd rosetta --help
```

To test and run Rosetta API endpoints for applications that are running and exposed, use the following command:

```
appd rosetta
     --blockchain "your application name (ex: gaia)"
     --network "your chain identifier (ex: testnet-1)"
     --tendermint "tendermint endpoint (ex: localhost:26657)"
     --grpc "gRPC endpoint (ex: localhost:9090)"
     --addr "rosetta binding address (ex: :8080)"
```

## Extensions

There are two ways in which you can customize and extend the implementation with your custom settings.

### Message extension

In order to make an `sdk.Msg` understandable by rosetta the only thing which is required is adding the methods to your messages that satisfy the `rosetta.Msg` interface. Examples on how to do so can be found in the staking types such as `MsgDelegate`, or in bank types such as `MsgSend`.

### Client interface override

In case more customization is required, it's possible to embed the Client type and override the methods which require customizations.

Example:

```go
package custom_client
import (

"context"
"github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/types"
"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server/rosetta/lib"
)

// CustomClient embeds the standard cosmos client
// which means that it implements the cosmos-rosetta-gateway Client
// interface while at the same time allowing to customize certain methods
type CustomClient struct {
    *rosetta.Client
}

func (c *CustomClient) ConstructionPayload(_ context.Context, request *types.ConstructionPayloadsRequest) (resp *types.ConstructionPayloadsResponse, err error) {
    // provide custom signature bytes
    panic("implement me")
}
```

NOTE: when using a customized client, the command cannot be used as the constructors required **may** differ, so it's required to create a new one. We intend to provide a way to init a customized client without writing extra code in the future.

### Error extension

Since rosetta requires to provide 'returned' errors to network options. In order to declare a new rosetta error, we use the `errors` package in cosmos-rosetta-gateway.

Example:

```go
package custom_errors
import crgerrs "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server/rosetta/lib/errors"

var customErrRetriable = true
var CustomError = crgerrs.RegisterError(100, "custom message", customErrRetriable, "description")
```

Note: errors must be registered before cosmos-rosetta-gateway's `Server`.`Start` method is called. Otherwise the registration will be ignored. Errors with same code will be ignored too.
