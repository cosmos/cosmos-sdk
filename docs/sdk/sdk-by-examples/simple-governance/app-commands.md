## App commands

We will need to add the newly created commands to our application. To do so, go to the `cmd` folder inside your root  directory:

```bash
// At root level of directory
cd cmd
```
`simplegovd` is the folder that stores the command for running the server daemon, whereas `simplegovcli` defines the commands of your application.
