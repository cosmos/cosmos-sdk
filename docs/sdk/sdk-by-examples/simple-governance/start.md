## Starting your own project 

To get started, you just have to follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/develop)repo
2. Code the modules needed by your application that do not already exist.
3. Create your app directory. In the app main file, import the module you need and instantiate the different stores.
4. Launch your blockchain.

Easy as pie! With the introduction over, let us delve into practice and learn how to code a SDK application with an example.
