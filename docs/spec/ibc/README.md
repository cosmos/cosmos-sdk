# Inter Blockchain Communication protocol

IBC was defined in the [cosmos whitepaper](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#inter-blockchain-communication-ibc),
and then in detail in a [specification paper](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/raw/master/CosmosIBCSpecification.pdf).

This package builds on that and includes detailed specifications, pseudocode and protocol specification. Please read the [table of contents](specification.md) of the IBC specification.
