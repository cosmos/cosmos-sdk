## Future Improvements

* **Better ICS Support**

The Cosmos Hub will initially  only support  ICS1 (KeyAPI) and  ICS20 (TokenAPI). The support of ICS0 (TendermintAPI), ICS21 (StakingAPI) and ICS22 (GovernanceAPI) modules will be impelmented in later versions. The supported modules are configurable in LCD. In this way, LCD could be used for a variable of occasions.

* **Efficient Improvements**

We expect LCD coulld be implemented in different languages. Thus application developers could build LCD as in-process part of their applications. This significant of architecture change can save network communcation cost and achieve more security.

*  **Mobile Support**

For now, the ecosystem of Golang development on mobile platforms (Android and iOS) is not mature. And the growing up process of this ecosystem may be a long story. So the more promising way is that we implement LCD in mobile platforms friendly languages, such as javascript and rust. We believe this will come true in near future.
