## Transactions

In this section we describe the processing of transactions for the `slashing` module.

### Unjail

If a validator was automatically unbonded due to downtime and wishes to come back online &
possibly rejoin the bonded set, it must send `TxUnjail`:

```
type TxUnjail struct {
    ValidatorAddr sdk.AccAddress
}

handleMsgUnjail(tx TxUnjail)

    validator = getValidator(tx.ValidatorAddr)
    if validator == nil
      fail with "No validator found"

    if !validator.Jailed
      fail with "Validator not jailed, cannot unjail"

    info = getValidatorSigningInfo(operator)
    if block time < info.JailedUntil
      fail with "Validator still jailed, cannot unjail until period has expired"

    validator.Jailed = false
    setValidator(validator)

    return
```

If the validator has enough stake to be in the top `n = MaximumBondedValidators`, they will be automatically rebonded,
and all delegators still delegated to the validator will be rebonded and begin to again collect
provisions and rewards.
