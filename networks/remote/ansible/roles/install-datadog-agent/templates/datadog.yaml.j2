# If you need a proxy to connect to the Internet, provide it here (default:
# disabled). You can use the 'no_proxy' list to specify hosts that should
# bypass the proxy. These settings might impact your checks requests, please
# refer to the specific check documentation for more details. Environment
# variables HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (coma-separated string) will
# override the values set here. See https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/proxy/.

#   https: http(s)://user:password@proxy_for_https:port
#   no_proxy:
#     - host1
#     - host2

# Setting this option to "yes" will tell the agent to skip validation of SSL/TLS certificates.
# This may be necessary if the agent is running behind a proxy. See this page for details:
# https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Proxy-Configuration#using-haproxy-as-a-proxy
# skip_ssl_validation: no

# Setting this option to "yes" will force the agent to only use TLS 1.2 when
# pushing data to the url specified in "dd_url".
# force_tls_12: no

# Force the hostname to whatever you want. (default: auto-detected)
# hostname: mymachine.mydomain

# Make the agent use "hostname -f" on unix-based systems as a last resort
# way of determining the hostname instead of Golang "os.Hostname()"
# This will be enabled by default in version 6.4

# Exclude containers from metrics and AD based on their name or image:
# An excluded container will not get any individual container metric reported for it.
# Please note that the `docker.containers.running`, `.stopped`, `.running.total` and
# `.stopped.total` metrics are not affected by these settings and always count all
# containers. This does not affect your per-container billing.

# How it works: include first.
# If a container matches an exclude rule, it won't be included unless it first matches an include rule.
#
# Rules are regexp.
#
# Examples:
# exclude all, except containers based on the 'ubuntu' image or the 'debian' image.
# ac_exclude: ["image:.*"]
# ac_include: ["image:ubuntu", "image:debian"]
#
# include all, except containers based on the 'ubuntu' image.
# ac_exclude: ["image:ubuntu"]

# exclude all debian images except containers with a name starting with 'frontend'.
# ac_exclude: ["image:debian"]
# ac_include: ["name:frontend.*"]
#
# ac_exclude: []
# ac_include: []
#
#
# Exclude default pause containers from orchestrators.
#
# By default the agent will not monitor kubernetes/openshift pause
# container. They will still be counted in the container count (just like
# excluded containers) since ignoring them would give a wrong impression
# about the docker daemon load.
#
# exclude_pause_container: true

# Exclude default containers from DockerCloud:
# The following configuration will instruct the agent to ignore the containers from Docker Cloud.
# You can remove the ones you want to collect.
# ac_exclude: ["image:dockercloud/network-daemon","image:dockercloud/cleanup","image:dockercloud/logrotate","image:dockercloud/events","image:dockercloud/ntpd"]

# URL where the ECS agent can be found. Standard cases will be autodetected.
# ecs_agent_url: http://localhost:51678
#

# Kubernetes kubelet connectivity
#
# The kubelet host and port should be autodetected when running inside a pod.
# If you run into connectivity issues, you can set these options according to
# your cluster setup:
# kubernetes_kubelet_host: autodetected
# kubernetes_http_kubelet_port: 10255
# kubernetes_https_kubelet_port: 10250
#
# When using HTTPS, we verify the kubelet's certificate, you can tune this:
# kubelet_tls_verify: true
# kubelet_client_ca: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
#
# If authentication is needed, the agent will use the pod's serviceaccount's
# credentials. If you want to use a different account, or are running the agent
# on the host, you can set the credentials to use here:
# kubelet_auth_token_path: /path/to/file
# kubelet_client_crt: /path/to/key
# kubelet_client_key: /path/to/key
#

# Kubernetes apiserver integration
#
# When running in a pod, the agent will automatically use the pod's serviceaccount
# to authenticate with the apiserver. If you wish to install the agent out of a pod
# or customise connection parameters, you can provide the path to a KubeConfig file
# see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/
#
# kubernetes_kubeconfig_path: /path/to/file
#
# In order to collect Kubernetes service names, the agent needs certain rights (see RBAC documentation in
# [docker readme](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfiles/agent/README.md#kubernetes)).
# You can disable this option or set how often (in seconds) the agent refreshes the internal mapping of services to
# ContainerIDs with the following options:
# kubernetes_collect_metadata_tags: true
# kubernetes_metadata_tag_update_freq: 60
# kubernetes_apiserver_client_timeout: 10
# kubernetes_apiserver_poll_freq: 30
#
# To collect Kubernetes events, leader election must be enabled and collect_kubernetes_events set to true.

#   If "disabled" it will be disabled altogether and won't start.
  enabled: "true"
#   The full path to the file where process-agent logs will be written.
#   log_file:
#   The interval, in seconds, at which we will run each check. If you want consistent
#   behavior between real-time you may set the Container/ProcessRT intervals to 10.
#   Defaults to 10s for normal checks and 2s for others.
#   intervals:
#     container:
#     container_realtime:
#     process:
#     process_realtime:
#   A list of regex patterns that will exclude a process if matched.
#   blacklist_patterns:
#   How many check results to buffer in memory when POST fails. The default is usually fine.
#   queue_size:
#   The maximum number of file descriptors to open when collecting net connections.
#   Only change if you are running out of file descriptors from the Agent.
#   max_proc_fds:
#   The maximum number of processes or containers per message.
#   Only change if the defaults are causing issues.
#   max_per_message:
#   Overrides the path to the Agent bin used for getting the hostname. The default is usually fine.
#   dd_agent_bin:
#   Overrides of the environment we pass to fetch the hostname. The default is usually fine.

#   Whether the Trace Agent should listen for non local traffic
#   Only enable if Traces are being sent to this Agent from another host/container
#   apm_non_local_traffic: false
#   Extra global sample rate to apply on all the traces
#   This sample rate is combined to the sample rate from the sampler logic, still promoting interesting traces
#   From 1 (no extra rate) to 0 (don't sample at all)
#   extra_sample_rate: 1.0
#   Maximum number of traces per second to sample.
#   The limit is applied over an average over a few minutes ; much bigger spikes are possible.
#   Set to 0 to disable the limit.
#   max_traces_per_second: 10
#   A blacklist of regular expressions can be provided to disable certain traces based on their resource name
#   all entries must be surrounded by double quotes and separated by commas
#   Example: ["(GET|POST) /healthcheck", "GET /V1"]
#   ignore_resources: []
