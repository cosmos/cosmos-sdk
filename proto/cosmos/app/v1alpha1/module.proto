  // A package should indicate its revision with a source code comment
  // above the package declaration in one of its fields containing the
  // test "Revision N" where N is an integer revision. All packages start
  // at revision 0 the first time they are released in a module.

  // When a new version of a module is released and items are added to existing
  // .proto files, these definitions should contain comments of the form
  // "Since Revision N" where N is an integer revision.
  //
  // When the module runtime starts up, it will check the pinned proto
  // image and panic if there are runtime protobuf definitions that are not
  // in the pinned descriptor which do not have
  // a "Since Revision N" comment or have a "Since Revision N" comment where
  // N is <= to the revision specified here. This indicates that the protobuf
  // files have been updated, but the pinned file descriptor hasn't. This behavior
  // ensures that:
  // * pinned proto images are up-to-date
  // * protobuf files are carefully annotated with revision comments which
  //   are important good client UX
  //
  // If there are items in the pinned file descriptor with a revision
  // greater than the value indicated here, this will also cause a panic
  // as it may mean that the pinned descriptor for a legacy module has been
  // improperly updated or that there is some other versioning discrepancy.
