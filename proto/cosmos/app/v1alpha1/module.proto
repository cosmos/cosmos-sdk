  //
  // When a new version of a module is released and items are added to existing
  // .proto files, these definitions should contain comments of the form
  // "Since: Revision N" where N is an integer revision.
  //
  // When the module runtime starts up, it will check the pinned proto
  // image and panic if there are runtime protobuf definitions that are not
  // in the pinned descriptor which do not have

  // N is <= to the revision specified here. This indicates that the protobuf
  // files have been updated, but the pinned file descriptor hasn't.

  // greater than the value indicated here, this will also cause a panic
  // as it may mean that the pinned descriptor for a legacy module has been
  // improperly updated or that there is some other versioning discrepancy.
  // Runtime protobuf definitions will also be checked for compatibility
  // with pinned file descriptors to make sure there are no incompatible changes.
  //

  // * pinned proto images are up-to-date
  // * protobuf files are carefully annotated with revision comments which
  //   are important good client UX
  // * protobuf files are changed in backwards and forwards compatible ways
