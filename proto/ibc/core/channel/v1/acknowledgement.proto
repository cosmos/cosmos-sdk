// Acknowledgement is the recommended acknowledgement format to be used by
// app-specific protocols.
// NOTE: The field numbers 21 and 22 were explicitly chosen to avoid accidental
// conflicts with other protobuf message formats used for acknowledgements.
// The first byte of any message with this format will be the non-ASCII values
// `0xaa` (result) or `0xb2` (error). Implemented as defined by ICS:
// https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#acknowledgement-envelope

  // response contains either a result or an error and must be non-empty
