	// AppOptions defines an interface that is passed into an application
	// constructor, typically used to set BaseApp options that are either supplied
	// via config file or through CLI arguments/flags. The underlying implementation

	// literal defined on the server Context. Note, casting Get calls may not yield
	// the expected types and could result in type assertion errors. It is recommend
	// to either use the cast package or perform manual conversion for safety.
