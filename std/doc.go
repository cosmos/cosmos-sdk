/*
Package std defines all the common and standard inter-module Cosmos SDK types and definitions
modules and applications can depend on. These types and definitions serve as
convenient starting point and also to act as an example or template of how said
types and definitions can be overridden/redefined.

Typically these will be used in application-specific units of business logic. These
types and definitions are different from the types you may find in a "core" or "types"
package as those should be considered the defacto types to be used and are not
application-specific.
