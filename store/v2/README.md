# Store

The `store` package contains the implementation of store/v2, which is the SDK's
abstraction around managing historical and committed state. See [ADR-065](../../docs/architecture/adr-065-store-v2.md)
and [Store v2 Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l6uXIjTPHOOWM5N4sUUmUfCZvePoa5SNfIEtmgvgQSU/edit#heading=h.nz8dqy6wa4g1) for a high-level overview of the design and rationale.

## Usage

The `store` package contains a `root.Store` type which is intended to act as an
abstraction layer around it's two primary constituent components - state storage (SS)
and state commitment (SC). It acts as the main entry point into storage for an
application to use in server/v2. Through `root.Store`, an application can query
and iterate over both current and historical data, commit new state, perform state
sync, and fetch commitment proofs.

A `root.Store` is intended to be initialized with already constructed SS and SC
backends (see relevant package documentation for instantiation details). Note,
from the perspective of `root.Store`, there is no notion of multi or single tree/store,
rather these are implementation details of SS and SC. For SS, we utilize store keys
to namespace raw key/value pairs. For SC, we utilize an abstraction, `commitment.CommitStore`,
to map store keys to a commitment trees.

## Upgrades

The `LoadVersionAndUpgrade` API of the `root.store` allows for adding or removing
store keys. This is useful for upgrading the chain with new modules or removing
old ones. The `Rename` feature is not supported in store/v2.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Store
    participant SS as StateStorage
    participant SC as StateCommitment
    alt SC is a UpgradeableStore
        S->>SC: LoadVersionAndUpgrade
        SC->>SC: Mount new store keys
        SC->>SC: Prune removed store keys
    end
    SC->>S: LoadVersion Result
    alt SS is a UpgradableDatabase
        S->>SS: PruneStoreKeys
    end
```

`PruneStoreKeys` does not remove the data from the SC and SS instantly. It only
marks the store keys as pruned. The actual data removal is done by the pruning
process of the underlying SS and SC.

## Migration

The migration from store/v1 to store/v2 is supported by the `MigrationManager` in
the `migration` package. See [Migration Manager](./migration/README.md) for more details.

## Pruning

The `root.Store` is NOT responsible for pruning. Rather, pruning is the responsibility
of the underlying SS and SC layers. This means pruning can be implementation specific,
such as being synchronous or asynchronous. See [Pruning Manager](./pruning/README.md) for more details.


## State Sync

The `root.Store` is NOT responsible for state sync. See [Snapshots Manager](./snapshots/README.md)
for more details.

## Test Coverage

The test coverage of the following logical components should be over 60%:
