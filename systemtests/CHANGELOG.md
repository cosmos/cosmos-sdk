<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Changelog entries are generated by git cliff ref: https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff

Each commit should be conventional, the following message groups are supported.

* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* docs: Documentation only changes
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: go, npm)
* ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: GH Actions)
* chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
* revert: Reverts a previous commit

When a change is made that affects the API or state machine, the commit message prefix should be suffixed with `!`.
