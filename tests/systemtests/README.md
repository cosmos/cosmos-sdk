# Testing

Test framework for system tests. 
Starts and interacts with a (multi node) blockchain in Go.
Supports
* CLI
* Servers
* Events
* RPC

Uses:
* testify
* gjson
* sjson
Server and client side are executed on the host machine

## Developer
### Test strategy
System tests cover the full stack via cli and a running (multi node) network. They are more expensive (in terms of time/ cpu) 
to run compared to unit or integration tests. 
Therefore, we focus on the **critical path** and do not cover every condition.

### Execute a single test

```sh
go test -tags system_test -count=1 -v . --run TestStakeUnstake  -verbose
```

Test cli parameters

* `-verbose` verbose output
* `-wait-time` duration - time to wait for chain events (default 30s)
* `-nodes-count` int - number of nodes in the cluster (default 4)

# Port ranges
With *n* nodes:
* `26657` - `26657+n` - RPC
* `1317` - `1317+n` - API
* `9090` - `9090+n` - GRPC
* `16656` - `16656+n` - P2P

For example Node *3* listens on `26660` for RPC calls
