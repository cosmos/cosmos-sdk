ExistenceProof takes a key and a value and a set of steps to perform on it.
The result of peforming all these steps will provide a "root hash", which can
be compared to the value in a header.

Since it is computationally infeasible to produce a hash collission for any of the used
cryptographic hash functions, if someone can provide a series of operations to transform
a given key and value into a root hash that matches some trusted root, these key and values
must be in the referenced merkle tree.

The only possible issue is maliablity in LeafOp, such as providing extra prefix data,
which should be controlled by a spec. Eg. with lengthOp as NONE,
  prefix = FOO, key = BAR, value = CHOICE
and
  prefix = F, key = OOBAR, value = CHOICE
would produce the same value.

With LengthOp this is tricker but not impossible. Which is why the "leafPrefixEqual" field
in the ProofSpec is valuable to prevent this mutability. And why all trees should
length-prefix the data before hashing it.
