# Test data for `confix` and `condiff`

The files in this directory are stock Cosmos SDK configuration files generated
by the last point release of each version series from v0.45 to present, along
with diffs between consecutive versions.

## Config Samples

The files named `vXX-app.toml` were generated by checking out and building
the corresponding version of Cosmos SDK v0.xx.y and initializing a new node in
an empty home directory. The resulting `app.toml` file was copied here.
The exact build instructions vary a bit, but a general repro looks like:

```shell
# This example uses v0.47, substitute the version of your choice.
git checkout release/v0.47.x

# Install dependencies
make install

# Confirm you go the version you expected, and generate the file.
simd version
simd init test --chain-id test

# Copy the file out.
cp ./.simapp/config/app.toml v47-app.toml
```

## Version Diffs

The files named `diff-XX-YY.txt` were generated by using the `condiff` tool on
the config samples for versions v0.XX and v0.YY:

```shell
condiff vXX-app.toml data/vYY-app.toml > testdata/diff-XX-YY.txt
```

The `baseline.txt` was computed in the same way, but using an empty starting
file so that we capture all the settings in the target:

```shell
condiff /dev/null data/v45-app.toml > testdata/baseline.txt
```
