		Use:   "add-batch-upgrade [flags]",
		Short: "Add multiple upgrade binaries at specified heights to cosmovisor",
		Long: `This command allows you to specify multiple upgrades at once at specific heights, copying or creating a batch upgrade file that's actively watched during 'cosmovisor run'.
You can provide upgrades in two ways:

1. Using --upgrade-file: Specify a path to a headerless CSV batch upgrade file in the format:
   upgrade-name,path-to-exec,upgrade-height

2. Using --upgrade-list: Provide a comma-separated list of upgrades.
   Each upgrade is defined by three colon-separated values:
   a. upgrade-name: A unique identifier for the upgrade
   b. path-to-exec: The file path to the upgrade's executable binary
   c. upgrade-height: The block height at which the upgrade should occur
   This creates a batch upgrade JSON file with the upgrade-info objects in the upgrade directory.

Note: You must provide either --upgrade-file or --upgrade-list.`,
		Example: `cosmovisor add-batch-upgrade --upgrade-list upgrade_v2:/path/to/v2/binary:1000000,upgrade_v3:/path/to/v3/binary:2000000

cosmovisor add-batch-upgrade --upgrade-file /path/to/batch_upgrade.csv`,
