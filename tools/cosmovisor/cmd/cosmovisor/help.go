Cosmovisor is a wrapper for a Cosmos SDK based App (set using the required %s env variable).
It starts the App by passing all provided arguments and monitors the %s/data/upgrade-info.json
file to perform an update. The upgrade-info.json file is created by the App x/upgrade module
when the blockchain height reaches an approved upgrade proposal. The file includes data from
the proposal. Cosmovisor interprets that data to perform an update: switch a current binary
and restart the App.

Configuration of Cosmovisor is done through environment variables, which are
documented in: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor/README.md`,
		cosmovisor.EnvName, cosmovisor.EnvHome,
	)
}
