# `x/consensus`

## Abstract 

Functionality to modify CometBFT's ABCI consensus params.

## Contents

* [State](#state)
* [Params](#params)
* [Keepers](#keepers)
* [Messages](#messages)
* [Consensus Messages](#consensus-messages)
* [Events](#events)
    * [Message Events](#message-events)


## State

The `x/consensus` module keeps state of the consensus params from cometbft.:

## Params

The consensus module stores it's params in state with the prefix of `0x05`,
it can be updated with governance or the address with authority.

* Params: `0x05 | ProtocolBuffer(cometbft.ConsensusParams)`

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/381de6452693a9338371223c232fba0c42773a4b/proto/cosmos/consensus/v1/consensus.proto#L11-L18
```

## Keepers

The consensus module provides methods to Set and Get consensus params. It is recommended to use the `x/consensus` module keeper to get consensus params instead of accessing them through the context.

## Messages

### UpdateParams

Update consensus params.

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/381de6452693a9338371223c232fba0c42773a4b/proto/cosmos/consensus/v1/tx.proto#L12-L47
```

The message will fail under the following conditions:

* The signer is not the set authority 
* Not all values are set

## Consensus Messages

The consensus module has a consensus message that is used to set the consensus params when the chain initializes. It is similar to the `UpdateParams` message but it is only used once at the start of the chain.

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/381de6452693a9338371223c232fba0c42773a4b/proto/cosmos/consensus/v1/consensus.proto#L9-L24
```

## Events

The consensus module emits the following events:

### Message Events

#### MsgUpdateParams

| Type   | Attribute Key | Attribute Value     |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| string | authority     | msg.Signer          |
| string | parameters    | consensus Parmeters |
