## Abstract

This paper specifies the Governance module of the Cosmos SDK, which was first
described in the [Cosmos Whitepaper](https://cosmos.network/about/whitepaper) in
June 2016.

The module enables Cosmos SDK based blockchain to support an on-chain governance
system. In this system, holders of the native staking token of the chain can vote
on proposals on a 1 token 1 vote basis. Next is a list of features the module
currently supports:

* **Proposal submission:** Users can submit proposals with a deposit. Once the
minimum deposit is reached, the proposal enters voting period.
* **Vote:** Participants can vote on proposals that reached MinDeposit
* **Inheritance and penalties:** Delegators inherit their validator's vote if
they don't vote themselves.
* **Claiming deposit:** Users that deposited on proposals can recover their
deposits if the proposal was accepted or rejected. If the proposal was vetoed, or never entered voting period, the deposit is burned.

This module will be used in the Cosmos Hub, the first Hub in the Cosmos network.
Features that may be added in the future are described in [Future Improvements](#future-improvements).

## Contents

The following specification uses *ATOM* as the native staking token. The module
can be adapted to any Proof-Of-Stake blockchain by replacing *ATOM* with the native
staking token of the chain.

## Concepts

*Disclaimer: This is work in progress. Mechanisms are susceptible to change.*

The governance process is divided in a few steps that are outlined below:

* **Proposal submission:** Proposal is submitted to the blockchain with a
  deposit.
* **Vote:** Once deposit reaches a certain value (`MinDeposit`), proposal is
  confirmed and vote opens. Bonded Atom holders can then send `TxGovVote`
  transactions to vote on the proposal.
* **Execution** After a period of time, the votes are tallied and depending
  on the result, the messages in the proposal will be executed.

### Proposal submission

#### Right to submit a proposal

Every account can submit proposals by sending a `MsgSubmitProposal` transaction.
Once a proposal is submitted, it is identified by its unique `proposalID`.

#### Proposal Messages

A proposal includes an array of `sdk.Msg`s which are executed automatically if the
proposal passes. The messages are executed by the governance `ModuleAccount` itself. Modules
such as `x/upgrade`, that want to allow certain messages to be executed by governance
only should add a whitelist within the respective msg server, granting the governance
module the right to execute the message once a quorum has been reached. The governance
module uses the `MsgServiceRouter` to check that these messages are correctly constructed
and have a respective path to execute on but do not perform a full validity check.

### Deposit

To prevent spam, proposals must be submitted with a deposit in the coins defined by
the `MinDeposit` param.

When a proposal is submitted, it has to be accompanied with a deposit that must be
strictly positive, but can be inferior to `MinDeposit`. The submitter doesn't need
to pay for the entire deposit on their own. The newly created proposal is stored in
an *inactive proposal queue* and stays there until its deposit passes the `MinDeposit`.
Other token holders can increase the proposal's deposit by sending a `Deposit`
transaction. If a proposal doesn't pass the `MinDeposit` before the deposit end time
(the time when deposits are no longer accepted), the proposal will be destroyed: the
proposal will be removed from state and the deposit will be burned (see x/gov `EndBlocker`).
When a proposal deposit passes the `MinDeposit` threshold (even during the proposal
submission) before the deposit end time, the proposal will be moved into the
*active proposal queue* and the voting period will begin.

The deposit is kept in escrow and held by the governance `ModuleAccount` until the
proposal is finalized (passed or rejected).

#### Deposit refund and burn

When a proposal is finalized, the coins from the deposit are either refunded or burned
according to the final tally of the proposal:

* If the proposal is approved or rejected but *not* vetoed, each deposit will be
  automatically refunded to its respective depositor (transferred from the governance
  `ModuleAccount`).
* When the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3, deposits will be burned from the
  governance `ModuleAccount` and the proposal information along with its deposit
  information will be removed from state.
* All refunded or burned deposits are removed from the state. Events are issued when
  burning or refunding a deposit.

### Vote

#### Participants

*Participants* are users that have the right to vote on proposals. On the
Cosmos Hub, participants are bonded Atom holders. Unbonded Atom holders and
other users do not get the right to participate in governance. However, they
can submit and deposit on proposals.

Note that when *participants* have bonded and unbonded Atoms, their voting power is calculated from their bonded Atom holdings only.

#### Voting period

Once a proposal reaches `MinDeposit`, it immediately enters `Voting period`. We
define `Voting period` as the interval between the moment the vote opens and
the moment the vote closes. `Voting period` should always be shorter than
`Unbonding period` to prevent double voting. The initial value of
`Voting period` is 2 weeks.

#### Option set

The option set of a proposal refers to the set of choices a participant can
choose from when casting its vote.

The initial option set includes the following options:

* `Yes`
* `No`
* `NoWithVeto`
* `Abstain`

`NoWithVeto` counts as `No` but also adds a `Veto` vote. `Abstain` option
allows voters to signal that they do not intend to vote in favor or against the
proposal but accept the result of the vote.

*Note: from the UI, for urgent proposals we should maybe add a ‘Not Urgent’ option that casts a `NoWithVeto` vote.*

#### Weighted Votes

[ADR-037](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-037-gov-split-vote.md) introduces the weighted vote feature which allows a staker to split their votes into several voting options. For example, it could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No.

Often times the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power. Currently, it is not possible for them to do "passthrough voting" and giving their users voting rights over their tokens. However, with this system, exchanges can poll their users for voting preferences, and then vote on-chain proportionally to the results of the poll.

To represent weighted vote on chain, we use the following Protobuf message.

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1beta1/gov.proto#L34-L47
```

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1beta1/gov.proto#L181-L201
```

For a weighted vote to be valid, the `options` field must not contain duplicate vote options, and the sum of weights of all options must be equal to 1.

### Quorum

Quorum is defined as the minimum percentage of voting power that needs to be
cast on a proposal for the result to be valid.

### Expedited Proposals

A proposal can be expedited, making the proposal use shorter voting duration and a higher tally threshold by its default. If an expedited proposal fails to meet the threshold within the scope of shorter voting duration, the expedited proposal is then converted to a regular proposal and restarts voting under regular voting conditions.

#### Threshold

Threshold is defined as the minimum proportion of `Yes` votes (excluding
`Abstain` votes) for the proposal to be accepted.

Initially, the threshold is set at 50% of `Yes` votes, excluding `Abstain`
votes. A possibility to veto exists if more than 1/3rd of all votes are
`NoWithVeto` votes.  Note, both of these values are derived from the `TallyParams`
on-chain parameter, which is modifiable by governance.
This means that proposals are accepted iff:

* There exist bonded tokens.
* Quorum has been achieved.
* The proportion of `Abstain` votes is inferior to 1/1.
* The proportion of `NoWithVeto` votes is inferior to 1/3, including
  `Abstain` votes.
* The proportion of `Yes` votes, excluding `Abstain` votes, at the end of
  the voting period is superior to 1/2.

For expedited proposals, by default, the threshold is higher than with a *normal proposal*, namely, 66.7%.

#### Inheritance

If a delegator does not vote, it will inherit its validator vote.

* If the delegator votes before its validator, it will not inherit from the
  validator's vote.
* If the delegator votes after its validator, it will override its validator
  vote with its own. If the proposal is urgent, it is possible
  that the vote will close before delegators have a chance to react and
  override their validator's vote. This is not a problem, as proposals require more than 2/3rd of the total voting power to pass, when tallied at the end of the voting period. Because as little as 1/3 + 1 validation power could collude to censor transactions, non-collusion is already assumed for ranges exceeding this threshold.

#### Validator’s punishment for non-voting

At present, validators are not punished for failing to vote.

#### Governance address

Later, we may add permissioned keys that could only sign txs from certain modules. For the MVP, the `Governance address` will be the main validator address generated at account creation. This address corresponds to a different PrivKey than the Tendermint PrivKey which is responsible for signing consensus messages. Validators thus do not have to sign governance transactions with the sensitive Tendermint PrivKey.

### Software Upgrade

If proposals are of type `SoftwareUpgradeProposal`, then nodes need to upgrade
their software to the new version that was voted. This process is divided into
two steps:

#### Signal

After a `SoftwareUpgradeProposal` is accepted, validators are expected to
download and install the new version of the software while continuing to run
the previous version. Once a validator has downloaded and installed the
upgrade, it will start signaling to the network that it is ready to switch by
including the proposal's `proposalID` in its *precommits*. (*Note: Confirmation that we want it in the precommit?*)

Note: There is only one signal slot per *precommit*. If several
`SoftwareUpgradeProposals` are accepted in a short timeframe, a pipeline will
form and they will be implemented one after the other in the order that they
were accepted.

#### Switch

Once a block contains more than 2/3rd *precommits* where a common
`SoftwareUpgradeProposal` is signaled, all the nodes (including validator
nodes, non-validating full nodes and light-nodes) are expected to switch to the
new version of the software.

Validators and full nodes can use an automation tool, such as [Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor), for automatically switching version of the chain.

## State

### Proposals

`Proposal` objects are used to tally votes and generally track the proposal's state.
They contain an array of arbitrary `sdk.Msg`'s which the governance module will attempt
to resolve and then execute if the proposal passes. `Proposal`'s are identified by a
unique id and contains a series of timestamps: `submit_time`, `deposit_end_time`,
`voting_start_time`, `voting_end_time` which track the lifecycle of a proposal

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L51-L99
```

A proposal will generally require more than just a set of messages to explain its
purpose but need some greater justification and allow a means for interested participants
to discuss and debate the proposal.
In most cases, **it is encouraged to have an off-chain system that supports the on-chain governance process**.
To accommodate for this, a proposal contains a special **`metadata`** field, a string,
which can be used to add context to the proposal. The `metadata` field allows custom use for networks,
however, it is expected that the field contains a URL or some form of CID using a system such as
[IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/). To support the case of
interoperability across networks, the SDK recommends that the `metadata` represents
the following `JSON` template:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "forum": "...", // a link to the discussion platform (i.e. Discord)
  "other": "..." // any extra data that doesn't correspond to the other fields
}
```

This makes it far easier for clients to support multiple networks.

The metadata has a maximum length that is chosen by the app developer, and
passed into the gov keeper as a config. The default maximum length in the SDK is 255 characters.

#### Writing a module that uses governance

There are many aspects of a chain, or of the individual modules that you may want to
use governance to perform such as changing various parameters. This is very simple
to do. First, write out your message types and `MsgServer` implementation. Add an
`authority` field to the keeper which will be populated in the constructor with the
governance module account: `govKeeper.GetGovernanceAccount().GetAddress()`. Then for
the methods in the `msg_server.go`, perform a check on the message that the signer
matches `authority`. This will prevent any user from executing that message.

### Parameters and base types

`Parameters` define the rules according to which votes are run. There can only
be one active parameter set at any given time. If governance wants to change a
parameter set, either to modify a value or add/remove a parameter field, a new
parameter set has to be created and the previous one rendered inactive.

#### DepositParams

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L152-L162
```

#### VotingParams

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L164-L168
```

#### TallyParams

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L170-L182
```

Parameters are stored in a global `GlobalParams` KVStore.

Additionally, we introduce some basic types:

```go
type Vote byte

const (
    VoteYes         = 0x1
    VoteNo          = 0x2
    VoteNoWithVeto  = 0x3
    VoteAbstain     = 0x4
)

type ProposalType  string

const (
    ProposalTypePlainText       = "Text"
    ProposalTypeSoftwareUpgrade = "SoftwareUpgrade"
)

type ProposalStatus byte


const (
    StatusNil           ProposalStatus = 0x00
    StatusDepositPeriod ProposalStatus = 0x01  // Proposal is submitted. Participants can deposit on it but not vote
    StatusVotingPeriod  ProposalStatus = 0x02  // MinDeposit is reached, participants can vote
    StatusPassed        ProposalStatus = 0x03  // Proposal passed and successfully executed
    StatusRejected      ProposalStatus = 0x04  // Proposal has been rejected
    StatusFailed        ProposalStatus = 0x05  // Proposal passed but failed execution
)
```

### Deposit

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L38-L49
```

### ValidatorGovInfo

This type is used in a temp map when tallying

```go
  type ValidatorGovInfo struct {
    Minus     sdk.Dec
    Vote      Vote
  }
```

## Stores

:::note
Stores are KVStores in the multi-store. The key to find the store is the first parameter in the list
:::

We will use one KVStore `Governance` to store four mappings:

* A mapping from `proposalID|'proposal'` to `Proposal`.
* A mapping from `proposalID|'addresses'|address` to `Vote`. This mapping allows
  us to query all addresses that voted on the proposal along with their vote by
  doing a range query on `proposalID:addresses`.
* A mapping from `ParamsKey|'Params'` to `Params`. This map allows to query all
  x/gov params.
* A mapping from `VotingPeriodProposalKeyPrefix|proposalID` to a single byte. This allows
  us to know if a proposal is in the voting period or not with very low gas cost.
  
For pseudocode purposes, here are the two function we will use to read or write in stores:

* `load(StoreKey, Key)`: Retrieve item stored at key `Key` in store found at key `StoreKey` in the multistore
* `store(StoreKey, Key, value)`: Write value `Value` at key `Key` in store found at key `StoreKey` in the multistore

### Proposal Processing Queue

**Store:**

* `ProposalProcessingQueue`: A queue `queue[proposalID]` containing all the
  `ProposalIDs` of proposals that reached `MinDeposit`. During each `EndBlock`,
  all the proposals that have reached the end of their voting period are processed.
  To process a finished proposal, the application tallies the votes, computes the
  votes of each validator and checks if every validator in the validator set has
  voted. If the proposal is accepted, deposits are refunded. Finally, the proposal
  content `Handler` is executed.

And the pseudocode for the `ProposalProcessingQueue`:

```go
  in EndBlock do

    for finishedProposalID in GetAllFinishedProposalIDs(block.Time)
      proposal = load(Governance, <proposalID|'proposal'>) // proposal is a const key

      validators = Keeper.getAllValidators()
      tmpValMap := map(sdk.AccAddress)ValidatorGovInfo

      // Initiate mapping at 0. This is the amount of shares of the validator's vote that will be overridden by their delegator's votes
      for each validator in validators
        tmpValMap(validator.OperatorAddr).Minus = 0

      // Tally
      voterIterator = rangeQuery(Governance, <proposalID|'addresses'>) //return all the addresses that voted on the proposal
      for each (voterAddress, vote) in voterIterator
        delegations = stakingKeeper.getDelegations(voterAddress) // get all delegations for current voter

        for each delegation in delegations
          // make sure delegation.Shares does NOT include shares being unbonded
          tmpValMap(delegation.ValidatorAddr).Minus += delegation.Shares
          proposal.updateTally(vote, delegation.Shares)

        _, isVal = stakingKeeper.getValidator(voterAddress)
        if (isVal)
          tmpValMap(voterAddress).Vote = vote

      tallyingParam = load(GlobalParams, 'TallyingParam')

      // Update tally if validator voted
      for each validator in validators
        if tmpValMap(validator).HasVoted
          proposal.updateTally(tmpValMap(validator).Vote, (validator.TotalShares - tmpValMap(validator).Minus))



      // Check if proposal is accepted or rejected
      totalNonAbstain := proposal.YesVotes + proposal.NoVotes + proposal.NoWithVetoVotes
      if (proposal.Votes.YesVotes/totalNonAbstain > tallyingParam.Threshold AND proposal.Votes.NoWithVetoVotes/totalNonAbstain  < tallyingParam.Veto)
        //  proposal was accepted at the end of the voting period
        //  refund deposits (non-voters already punished)
        for each (amount, depositor) in proposal.Deposits
          depositor.AtomBalance += amount

        stateWriter, err := proposal.Handler()
        if err != nil
            // proposal passed but failed during state execution
            proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusFailed
         else
            // proposal pass and state is persisted
            proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusAccepted
            stateWriter.save()
      else
        // proposal was rejected
        proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusRejected

      store(Governance, <proposalID|'proposal'>, proposal)
```

### Legacy Proposal

A legacy proposal is the old implementation of governance proposal.
Contrary to proposal that can contain any messages, a legacy proposal allows to submit a set of pre-defined proposals.
These proposal are defined by their types.

While proposals should use the new implementation of the governance proposal, we need still to use legacy proposal in order to submit a `software-upgrade` and a `cancel-software-upgrade` proposal.

More information on how to submit proposals in the [client section](#client).

## Messages

### Proposal Submission

Proposals can be submitted by any account via a `MsgSubmitProposal` transaction.

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/tx.proto#L42-L69
```

All `sdk.Msgs` passed into the `messages` field of a `MsgSubmitProposal` message
must be registered in the app's `MsgServiceRouter`. Each of these messages must
have one signer, namely the gov module account. And finally, the metadata length
must not be larger than the `maxMetadataLen` config passed into the gov keeper.

**State modifications:**

* Generate new `proposalID`
* Create new `Proposal`
* Initialise `Proposal`'s attributes
* Decrease balance of sender by `InitialDeposit`
* If `MinDeposit` is reached:
    * Push `proposalID` in `ProposalProcessingQueue`
* Transfer `InitialDeposit` from the `Proposer` to the governance `ModuleAccount`

A `MsgSubmitProposal` transaction can be handled according to the following
pseudocode.

```go
// PSEUDOCODE //
// Check if MsgSubmitProposal is valid. If it is, create proposal //

upon receiving txGovSubmitProposal from sender do

  if !correctlyFormatted(txGovSubmitProposal)
    // check if proposal is correctly formatted and the messages have routes to other modules. Includes fee payment.
    // check if all messages' unique Signer is the gov acct.
    // check if the metadata is not too long.
    throw

  initialDeposit = txGovSubmitProposal.InitialDeposit
  if (initialDeposit.Atoms <= 0) OR (sender.AtomBalance < initialDeposit.Atoms)
    // InitialDeposit is negative or null OR sender has insufficient funds
    throw

  if (txGovSubmitProposal.Type != ProposalTypePlainText) OR (txGovSubmitProposal.Type != ProposalTypeSoftwareUpgrade)

  sender.AtomBalance -= initialDeposit.Atoms

  depositParam = load(GlobalParams, 'DepositParam')

  proposalID = generate new proposalID
  proposal = NewProposal()

  proposal.Messages = txGovSubmitProposal.Messages
  proposal.Metadata = txGovSubmitProposal.Metadata
  proposal.TotalDeposit = initialDeposit
  proposal.SubmitTime = <CurrentTime>
  proposal.DepositEndTime = <CurrentTime>.Add(depositParam.MaxDepositPeriod)
  proposal.Deposits.append({initialDeposit, sender})
  proposal.Submitter = sender
  proposal.YesVotes = 0
  proposal.NoVotes = 0
  proposal.NoWithVetoVotes = 0
  proposal.AbstainVotes = 0
  proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusOpen

  store(Proposals, <proposalID|'proposal'>, proposal) // Store proposal in Proposals mapping
  return proposalID
```

### Deposit

Once a proposal is submitted, if
`Proposal.TotalDeposit < ActiveParam.MinDeposit`, Atom holders can send
`MsgDeposit` transactions to increase the proposal's deposit.

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/tx.proto#L134-L147
```

**State modifications:**

* Decrease balance of sender by `deposit`
* Add `deposit` of sender in `proposal.Deposits`
* Increase `proposal.TotalDeposit` by sender's `deposit`
* If `MinDeposit` is reached:
    * Push `proposalID` in `ProposalProcessingQueueEnd`
* Transfer `Deposit` from the `proposer` to the governance `ModuleAccount`

A `MsgDeposit` transaction has to go through a number of checks to be valid.
These checks are outlined in the following pseudocode.

```go
// PSEUDOCODE //
// Check if MsgDeposit is valid. If it is, increase deposit and check if MinDeposit is reached

upon receiving txGovDeposit from sender do
  // check if proposal is correctly formatted. Includes fee payment.

  if !correctlyFormatted(txGovDeposit)
    throw

  proposal = load(Proposals, <txGovDeposit.ProposalID|'proposal'>) // proposal is a const key, proposalID is variable

  if (proposal == nil)
    // There is no proposal for this proposalID
    throw

  if (txGovDeposit.Deposit.Atoms <= 0) OR (sender.AtomBalance < txGovDeposit.Deposit.Atoms) OR (proposal.CurrentStatus != ProposalStatusOpen)

    // deposit is negative or null
    // OR sender has insufficient funds
    // OR proposal is not open for deposit anymore

    throw

  depositParam = load(GlobalParams, 'DepositParam')

  if (CurrentBlock >= proposal.SubmitBlock + depositParam.MaxDepositPeriod)
    proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusClosed

  else
    // sender can deposit
    sender.AtomBalance -= txGovDeposit.Deposit.Atoms

    proposal.Deposits.append({txGovVote.Deposit, sender})
    proposal.TotalDeposit.Plus(txGovDeposit.Deposit)

    if (proposal.TotalDeposit >= depositParam.MinDeposit)
      // MinDeposit is reached, vote opens

      proposal.VotingStartBlock = CurrentBlock
      proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusActive
      ProposalProcessingQueue.push(txGovDeposit.ProposalID)

  store(Proposals, <txGovVote.ProposalID|'proposal'>, proposal)
```

### Vote

Once `ActiveParam.MinDeposit` is reached, voting period starts. From there,
bonded Atom holders are able to send `MsgVote` transactions to cast their
vote on the proposal.

```protobuf reference
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/tx.proto#L92-L108
```

**State modifications:**

* Record `Vote` of sender

:::note
Gas cost for this message has to take into account the future tallying of the vote in EndBlocker.
:::

Next is a pseudocode outline of the way `MsgVote` transactions are handled:

```go
  // PSEUDOCODE //
  // Check if MsgVote is valid. If it is, count vote//

  upon receiving txGovVote from sender do
    // check if proposal is correctly formatted. Includes fee payment.

    if !correctlyFormatted(txGovDeposit)
      throw

    proposal = load(Proposals, <txGovDeposit.ProposalID|'proposal'>)

    if (proposal == nil)
      // There is no proposal for this proposalID
      throw


    if  (proposal.CurrentStatus == ProposalStatusActive)


        // Sender can vote if
        // Proposal is active
        // Sender has some bonds

        store(Governance, <txGovVote.ProposalID|'addresses'|sender>, txGovVote.Vote)   // Voters can vote multiple times. Re-voting overrides previous vote. This is ok because tallying is done once at the end.
```

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### proposal deposits

The `deposits` endpoint allows users to query all deposits for a given proposal.

Using legacy v1beta1:

```bash
/cosmos/gov/v1beta1/proposals/{proposal_id}/deposits
```

Example:

```bash
curl localhost:1317/cosmos/gov/v1beta1/proposals/1/deposits
```

Example Output:

```bash
{
  "deposits": [
    {
      "proposal_id": "1",
      "depositor": "cosmos1..",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "stake",
          "amount": "10000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

Using v1:

```bash
/cosmos/gov/v1/proposals/{proposal_id}/deposits
```

Example:

```bash
curl localhost:1317/cosmos/gov/v1/proposals/1/deposits
```

Example Output:

```bash
{
  "deposits": [
    {
      "proposal_id": "1",
      "depositor": "cosmos1..",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "stake",
          "amount": "10000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

#### tally

The `tally` endpoint allows users to query the tally of a given proposal.

Using legacy v1beta1:

```bash
/cosmos/gov/v1beta1/proposals/{proposal_id}/tally
```

Example:

```bash
curl localhost:1317/cosmos/gov/v1beta1/proposals/1/tally
```

Example Output:

```bash
{
  "tally": {
    "yes": "1000000",
    "abstain": "0",
    "no": "0",
    "no_with_veto": "0"
  }
}
```

Using v1:

```bash
/cosmos/gov/v1/proposals/{proposal_id}/tally
```

Example:

```bash
curl localhost:1317/cosmos/gov/v1/proposals/1/tally
```

Example Output:

```bash
{
  "tally": {
    "yes": "1000000",
    "abstain": "0",
    "no": "0",
    "no_with_veto": "0"
  }
}
```

## Metadata

The gov module has two locations for metadata where users can provide further context about the on-chain actions they are taking. By default all metadata fields have a 255 character length field where metadata can be stored in json format, either on-chain or off-chain depending on the amount of data required. Here we provide a recommendation for the json structure and where the data should be stored. There are two important factors in making these recommendations. First, that the gov and group modules are consistent with one another, note the number of proposals made by all groups may be quite large. Second, that client applications such as block explorers and governance interfaces have confidence in the consistency of metadata structure accross chains.

### Proposal

Location: off-chain as json object stored on IPFS (mirrors [group proposal](../group/README.md#metadata))

```json
{
  "title": "",
  "authors": [""],
  "summary": "",
  "details": "",
  "proposal_forum_url": "",
  "vote_option_context": "",
}
```

:::note
The `authors` field is an array of strings, this is to allow for multiple authors to be listed in the metadata.
In v0.46, the `authors` field is a comma-separated string. Frontends are encouraged to support both formats for backwards compatibility.
:::

### Vote

Location: on-chain as json within 255 character limit (mirrors [group vote](../group/README.md#metadata))

```json
{
  "justification": "",
}
```

## Future Improvements

The current documentation only describes the minimum viable product for the
governance module. Future improvements may include:

* **`BountyProposals`:** If accepted, a `BountyProposal` creates an open
  bounty. The `BountyProposal` specifies how many Atoms will be given upon
  completion. These Atoms will be taken from the `reserve pool`. After a
  `BountyProposal` is accepted by governance, anybody can submit a
  `SoftwareUpgradeProposal` with the code to claim the bounty. Note that once a
  `BountyProposal` is accepted, the corresponding funds in the `reserve pool`
  are locked so that payment can always be honored. In order to link a
  `SoftwareUpgradeProposal` to an open bounty, the submitter of the
  `SoftwareUpgradeProposal` will use the `Proposal.LinkedProposal` attribute.
  If a `SoftwareUpgradeProposal` linked to an open bounty is accepted by
  governance, the funds that were reserved are automatically transferred to the
  submitter.
* **Complex delegation:** Delegators could choose other representatives than
  their validators. Ultimately, the chain of representatives would always end
  up to a validator, but delegators could inherit the vote of their chosen
  representative before they inherit the vote of their validator. In other
  words, they would only inherit the vote of their validator if their other
  appointed representative did not vote.
* **Better process for proposal review:** There would be two parts to
  `proposal.Deposit`, one for anti-spam (same as in MVP) and an other one to
  reward third party auditors.
