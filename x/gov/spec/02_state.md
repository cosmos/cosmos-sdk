# State

## Proposals

`Proposal` objects are used to tally votes and generally track the proposal's state.
They contain an array of arbitrary `sdk.Msg`'s which the governance module will attempt
to resolve and then execute if the proposal passes. `Proposal`'s are identified by a
unique id and contains a series of timestamps: `submit_time`, `deposit_end_time`,
`voting_start_time`, `voting_end_time` which track the lifecycle of a proposal

A proposal will generally require more than just a set of messages to explain its
purpose but need some greater justification and allow a means for interested participants
to discuss and debate the proposal. In most cases, it is encouraged to have an off-chain
system that supports the on-chain governance process. To accommodate for this, a
proposal contains a special `metadata` field, an array of bytes, which can be used to
add context to the proposal. The `metadata` field allows custom use for networks, however,
it is expected that the field contain a URL or some form of CID using a system such as
[IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/). To support the case of
interoperability across networks, the SDK recommends that the `metadata` represents
the following `JSON` template:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "forum": "...", // a link to the discussion platform (i.e. Discord)
  "other": "..." // any extra data that doesn't correspond to the other fields
}
```

This makes it far easier for clients to support multiple networks.

The metadata has a maximum length that is chosen by the app developer, and
passed into the gov keeper as a config.

### Writing a module that uses governance

There are many aspects of a chain, or of the individual modules that you may want to
use governance to perform such as changing various parameters. This is very simple
to do. First, write out your message types and `MsgServer` implementation. Add an
`authority` field to the keeper which will be populated in the constructor with the
governance module account: `govKeeper.GetGovernanceAccount().GetAddress()`. Then for
the methods in the `msg_server.go`, perform a check on the message that the signer
matches `authority`. This will prevent any user from executing that message.

## Parameters and base types

`Parameters` define the rules according to which votes are run. There can only
be one active parameter set at any given time. If governance wants to change a
parameter set, either to modify a value or add/remove a parameter field, a new
parameter set has to be created and the previous one rendered inactive.

### TallyParams

Parameters are stored in a global `GlobalParams` KVStore.

Additionally, we introduce some basic types:

```go
type Vote byte

const (
    VoteYes         = 0x1
    VoteNo          = 0x2
    VoteNoWithVeto  = 0x3
    VoteAbstain     = 0x4
)

type ProposalType  string

const (
    ProposalTypePlainText       = "Text"
    ProposalTypeSoftwareUpgrade = "SoftwareUpgrade"
)

type ProposalStatus byte


const (
	StatusNil           ProposalStatus = 0x00
    StatusDepositPeriod ProposalStatus = 0x01  // Proposal is submitted. Participants can deposit on it but not vote
    StatusVotingPeriod  ProposalStatus = 0x02  // MinDeposit is reached, participants can vote
    StatusPassed        ProposalStatus = 0x03  // Proposal passed and successfully executed
    StatusRejected      ProposalStatus = 0x04  // Proposal has been rejected
    StatusFailed        ProposalStatus = 0x05  // Proposal passed but failed execution
)
```

## ValidatorGovInfo

This type is used in a temp map when tallying

```go
  type ValidatorGovInfo struct {
    Minus     sdk.Dec
    Vote      Vote
  }
```

## Stores

_Stores are KVStores in the multi-store. The key to find the store is the first
parameter in the list_`

We will use one KVStore `Governance` to store two mappings:

- A mapping from `proposalID|'proposal'` to `Proposal`.
- A mapping from `proposalID|'addresses'|address` to `Vote`. This mapping allows
  us to query all addresses that voted on the proposal along with their vote by
  doing a range query on `proposalID:addresses`.

For pseudocode purposes, here are the two function we will use to read or write in stores:

- `load(StoreKey, Key)`: Retrieve item stored at key `Key` in store found at key `StoreKey` in the multistore
- `store(StoreKey, Key, value)`: Write value `Value` at key `Key` in store found at key `StoreKey` in the multistore

## Proposal Processing Queue

**Store:**

- `ProposalProcessingQueue`: A queue `queue[proposalID]` containing all the
  `ProposalIDs` of proposals that reached `MinDeposit`. During each `EndBlock`,
  all the proposals that have reached the end of their voting period are processed.
  To process a finished proposal, the application tallies the votes, computes the
  votes of each validator and checks if every validator in the validator set has
  voted. If the proposal is accepted, deposits are refunded. Finally, the proposal
  content `Handler` is executed.

And the pseudocode for the `ProposalProcessingQueue`:

```go
  in EndBlock do

    for finishedProposalID in GetAllFinishedProposalIDs(block.Time)
      proposal = load(Governance, <proposalID|'proposal'>) // proposal is a const key

      validators = Keeper.getAllValidators()
      tmpValMap := map(sdk.AccAddress)ValidatorGovInfo

      // Initiate mapping at 0. This is the amount of shares of the validator's vote that will be overridden by their delegator's votes
      for each validator in validators
        tmpValMap(validator.OperatorAddr).Minus = 0

      // Tally
      voterIterator = rangeQuery(Governance, <proposalID|'addresses'>) //return all the addresses that voted on the proposal
      for each (voterAddress, vote) in voterIterator
        delegations = stakingKeeper.getDelegations(voterAddress) // get all delegations for current voter

        for each delegation in delegations
          // make sure delegation.Shares does NOT include shares being unbonded
          tmpValMap(delegation.ValidatorAddr).Minus += delegation.Shares
          proposal.updateTally(vote, delegation.Shares)

        _, isVal = stakingKeeper.getValidator(voterAddress)
        if (isVal)
          tmpValMap(voterAddress).Vote = vote

      tallyingParam = load(GlobalParams, 'TallyingParam')

      // Update tally if validator voted they voted
      for each validator in validators
        if tmpValMap(validator).HasVoted
          proposal.updateTally(tmpValMap(validator).Vote, (validator.TotalShares - tmpValMap(validator).Minus))



      // Check if proposal is accepted or rejected
      totalNonAbstain := proposal.YesVotes + proposal.NoVotes + proposal.NoWithVetoVotes
      if (proposal.Votes.YesVotes/totalNonAbstain > tallyingParam.Threshold AND proposal.Votes.NoWithVetoVotes/totalNonAbstain  < tallyingParam.Veto)
        //  proposal was accepted at the end of the voting period
        //  refund deposits (non-voters already punished)
        for each (amount, depositor) in proposal.Deposits
          depositor.AtomBalance += amount

        stateWriter, err := proposal.Handler()
        if err != nil
            // proposal passed but failed during state execution
            proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusFailed
         else
            // proposal pass and state is persisted
            proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusAccepted
            stateWriter.save()
      else
        // proposal was rejected
        proposal.CurrentStatus = ProposalStatusRejected

      store(Governance, <proposalID|'proposal'>, proposal)
```
