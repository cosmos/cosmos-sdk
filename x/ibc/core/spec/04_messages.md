# Messages

In this section we describe the processing of the IBC messages and the corresponding updates to the state.

## ICS 02 - Client

### MsgCreateClient

A light client is created using the `MsgCreateClient`.

```go
type MsgCreateClient struct {
  ClientId        string
  ClientState     *types.Any // proto-packed client state
  ConsensusState  *types.Any // proto-packed consensus state
  Signer          sdk.AccAddress
}
```

This message is expected to fail if:

- `ClientId` is invalid (see naming requirements)
- `ClientState` is empty or invalid
- `ConsensusState` is empty or invalid
- `Signer` is empty
- A light client with the provided id and type already exist

The message creates and stores a light client with the given ID and consensus type,
stores the validator set as the `Commiter` of the given consensus state and stores
both the consensus state and its commitment root (i.e app hash).

### MsgUpdateClient

A light client is updated with a new header using the `MsgUpdateClient`.

```go
type MsgUpdateClient struct {
  ClientId string
  Header   *types.Any // proto-packed header
  Signer   sdk.AccAddress
}
```

This message is expected to fail if:

- `ClientId` is invalid (not alphanumeric or not within 10-20 characters)
- `Header` is empty or invalid
- `Signer` is empty
- A `ClientState` hasn't been created for the given ID
- the header's client type is different from the registered one
- the client is frozen due to misbehaviour and cannot be updated

The message validates the header and updates the consensus state with the new
height, commitment root and validator sets, which are then stored.

### MsgSubmitMisbehaviour

Submit a evidence of light client misbehaviour to freeze the client state and prevent additional packets from being relayed.

```go
type MsgSubmitMisbehaviour struct {
  ClientId     string
  Misbehaviour *types.Any // proto-packed misbehaviour
  Signer       sdk.AccAddress
}
```

This message is expected to fail if:

- `ClientId` is invalid (not alphanumeric or not within 10-20 characters)
- `Misbehaviour` is empty or invalid
- `Signer` is empty
- A `ClientState` hasn't been created for the given ID
- `Misbehaviour` check failed

The message validates the header and updates the consensus state with the new
height, commitment root and validator sets, which are then stored.

## ICS 03 - Connection

### MsgConnectionOpenInit

A connection is initialized on a light client using the `MsgConnectionOpenInit`.

```go
type MsgConnectionOpenInit struct {
