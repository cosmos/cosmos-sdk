## Abstract

This paper defines the implementation of the ICS06 protocol on the Cosmos SDK. For the general
specification please refer to the [ICS06 Specification](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-006-solo-machine-client).

This Solo Machine Light Client supports single-signature public keys and multi-signature public
keys. The client is capable of handling public key updates by header and governance proposals as
well as client misbehaviour. Proofs of the counterparty state are generated by the solo machine
client signing over the desired state with a certain sequence, diversifier, and timestamp.
