# State

The `x/nameservice` module

The state represents your application at a given moment. It tells how much token each account possesses, what are the owners and price of each name, and to what value each name resolves to.

The state of tokens and accounts is defined by the auth and bank modules.

<!-- mostly placeholder, how is state different than events? where can I find the state details for nameservice? -->
