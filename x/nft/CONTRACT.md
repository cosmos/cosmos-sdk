# Contract

This document outlines the "soft contract" expected by the `CODEOWNERS` and maintainers
of the `x/nft` module to follow and uphold. The agreed-upon members are expected
to abide by the following:

- Review and provide feedback on PRs that primarily impact or modify the `x/nft`
module within 30 days.
- Review and provide feedback on issues related to the `x/nft` module within 30
days.
- Maintain compatibility with the APIs, design philosophy, architecture and the
broader set of tools (e.g. simulation) within the SDK.

If the broader set of `CODEOWNERS` and maintainers of the SDK deem that the stated
contract has been breached by a containing member of the `x/nft` module, that
member may be removed with or without warning from the `CODEOWNERS`. If the entire
set of owners and maintainers are deemed to break the contract, the `x/nft` module
maybe removed with or without warning from the SDK.
